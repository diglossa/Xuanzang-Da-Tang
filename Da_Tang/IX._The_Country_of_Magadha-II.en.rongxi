Eulogy of the Buddha

Eulogy of Xuanzang

Note by Bianji

The country of Jāguda is more than seven thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city, called Hexina (Ghazni), is over thirty _li_ in circuit; the capital is sometimes located in the city of Hesaluo (Guzar), which is also over thirty _li_ in circuit.

Both cities are strongly fortified in invulnerable positions. The mountains and valleys are rich in natural resources and the cultivated farmlands, divided by ridges, are high and dry. Crops are sown in proper seasons. Winter wheat is abundant and vegetation is luxuriant with profuse flowers and fin it. The soil is good for growing aromatic turmeric and it produces the _hiṅgu_ herb _(Ferula asafoetida),_ which grows in Rama-Indus Valley. In the city of Hesaluo there are gushing springs and the water flows to all sides; the people make use of it for irrigation. The climate is severely cold with much frost and snow. The people are frivolous and impetuous by nature and deceitful in disposition.

They are fond of learning and are skillful in many kinds of crafts. They are clever, if lacking in discernment, and can recite a work of several myriads of words in a day. Their written and spoken language differ from those of other countries. They produce more empty talk than real action. Although they worship various gods they respect the Triple Gem. There are several hundred monasteries with more than ten thousand monks, all of whom study Mahayana teachings. The reigning king is a man of pine faith who inherited the throne handed down through many generations. He has engaged himself in performing meritorious deeds and is intelligent and studious. There are more than ten stupas built by King Aśoka. _Deva_ temples number several tens and the heretics, who are in the majority, live together. Their disciples are extremely numerous and they worship the god Sunā.

Formerly this god moved from Aruṇa Mountain in the country of Kāpiśī to Sunāśīra Mountain in the south of this country. Acting like a tyrant and doing evil deeds, he rode roughshod over the inhabitants. Those who have faith in him and seek his protection have their wishes fulfilled and those who despise him incur calamity. Thus the people, far and near and high and low, revere him with awe. The kings, ministers, officials, and common people, who observe different customs in neighboring countries, come here without making appointments on an auspicious day each year. They offer either gold, silver, and rare gems or they present sheep, horses, and other domestic animals to the god in competition with each other to show their piety and sincerity. Therefore gold and silver are scattered all over the ground and sheep and horses fill up the valley. Nobody dares to covet them; everyone is eager to make offerings to the god. To those who respect and serve the heretics and practice asceticism wholeheartedly, the god imparts magical incantations, of which the heretics make effective use in most cases; they are quite efficacious for the treatment of disease.

From here going northward for more than five hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Vṛjiṣṭhāna. The country of Vṛjiṣṭhāna is more than two thousand _li_ from east to west and over one thousand _li_ from south to north. Its capital city, Hubina, is over twenty _li_ in circuit. The native products and customs are the same as in the country of Jāguda but the language is different. The climate is very cold and the people are rustic and violent by nature. The king, who is of Turkish stock, has deep faith in the Triple Gem, advocates learning, and respects people of virtue.

Proceeding northeast from this country over mountains and across rivers, I passed several tens of small frontier towns in the country of Kāpiśī and reached the Bālasena Range of the Great Snow Mountains. The range is extremely lofty and precipitous, with dangerous and sloping stone steps on a tortuous path winding among the cliffs and peaks, sometimes descending into a deep ravine and ascending to a high precipice. Even in the height of summer it is frozen; one has to break ice while proceeding on the way. After a journey of three days I reached the top of the range, where the cold wind is strong and piercing and the accumulated snow fills the valley. Whenever travelers pass through this place they cannot halt their journey. Even a falcon cannot fly over the range and has to alight and walk across it and then continue its flight. When one looks down on the lower mountains they appear to be small mounds, so this is a very high range in Jambudvīpa. In the mountains there are no trees but many rocky peaks standing closely together, resembling a forest.

After a journey of three more days I descended from the range and reached the country of Andarāb. The country of Andarāb, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than three thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is fourteen or fifteen _li_ in circuit. It has no sovereign ruler and is a dependency of the Turks. Mountains and hills connect with one another and the plains are narrow and small. The climate is very cold with strong winds and heavy snow. Crops are abundant and the land is good for growing flowers and fruit. The people are rustic and violent by nature, without moral discipline. They have no idea of sin or merit and are not fond of learning. They erect only _deva_ temples but a few of them believe in the buddha-dharma. There are three monasteries with a few tens of monks, all of whom study the teachings of the Mahāsāṃghika school. There is one stupa built by King Aśoka.

Going northwest from there, entering valleys, crossing rivers, and passing a number of small towns on a journey of more than four hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Khost. The country of Khost, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is less than one thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over ten _li_ in circuit. It has no sovereign ruler and is a dependency of the Turks. There are many mountains and the plains are narrow and small. The climate is windy and cold but there are abundant crops and plenty of flowers and fruit. The people are rustic and violent by nature and the society lacks legal institutions. There are three monasteries with few monks.

From here going northwest, crossing mountains and valleys and passing a number of towns and villages on a journey of more than three hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Huoh. The country of Huoh, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than two thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over twenty _li_ in circuit. It has no independent mler and is under the control of the Turks. The terrain is flat and crops are sown in the proper seasons. Vegetation is luxuriant with profuse flowers and fruit. The climate is mild and pleasant and the social customs are simple and honest. The people are of a rash and fiery disposition and wear garments made of felt and hempen cloth. Most of them believe in the Triple Gem; a few worship various gods. There are over ten monasteries with several hundred monks who study and practice the teachings of both the Mahayana and Hinayana schools. The king is a Turk who rules over the various small countries south of the Iron Gate and always travels from one country to another, without a permanent seat of government.

From here going eastward I entered the Cong Ling (“Onion Range”), the center of Jambudvīpa. On the south it connects with the Great Snow Mountains, on the north it reaches the Hot Sea and the Thousand Springs, on the west it borders the country of Huoh, and on the east it adjoins the country of Wusha. On each side there are hundreds of cliffs and ridges lining up in a row several thousand _li_ in length. The deep valleys are perilous and precipitous with accumulated ice and snow that never melt; the cold wind is strong and piercing. It is called the Onion Range because many fistular onions are grown on the mountains, or it may be so called because of the onion-green color of the cliffs.

Going east for more than one hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Mungān. The country of Mungān, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than four hundred _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over fifteen or sixteen _li_ in circuit. The native products and social customs are generally the same as in the country of Huoh. It has no sovereign ruler and is a dependency of the Turks.

To the east is the country of Alini. The country of Alini, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is located on both banks of the Oxus, with a circumference of more than three hundred _li;_ its capital city is over fourteen or fifteen _li_ in circuit. The native products and social customs are generally the same as in the country of Huoh.

To the east is the country of Rāhu. The country of Rāhu, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, borders the Oxus River in the north and is more than two hundred _li_ in circuit; its capital city is over fourteen or fifteen _li_ in circuit. The native products and social customs are generally the same as in the country of Huoh.

From the country of Mungān going east over high ranges, across deep valleys, and passing several cities in the plains on a journey of more than three hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Krisma. The country of Krisma, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than one thousand _li_ from east to west and over three hundred _li_ from south to north. Its capital city is fifteen or sixteen _li_ in circuit. The native products and social customs are generally the same as in the country of Mungān; the only difference is that the people are violent and malicious in disposition.

To the north is Pārghar. The country of Pārghar, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than one hundred _li_ from east to west and over three hundred _li_ from south to north. Its capital city is over twenty _li_ in circuit. The native products and social customs are generally the same as in the country of Krisma.

Going east from the country of Krisma over mountains and across rivers on a journey of more than three hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Himatala. The country of Himatala, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than three thousand _li_ in circuit. The land has a chain of mountains and valleys and the soil is fertile, good for growing crops and producing abundant winter wheat. Vegetation of diverse kinds thrives and fruit of every variety is profuse. The climate is bitterly cold and the people are violent and impetuous in disposition, not knowing what is iniquitous and what is meritorious. They are short and ugly in their features and their ways and manners, as well as their garments made of felt, fur, and hempen cloth, are quite the same as those of the Turks. Their married women wear a wooden horn about three feet high as a headdress, with two branches in front to represent their husbands’ parents, the upper branch indicating the father and the lower one standing for the mother. When one of the woman’s parents has died the branch indicating the deceased person is removed; when both parents have died the horn headdress is discarded altogether.

Formerly this was a powerful country and the royal lineage was of Sākya stock. Most of the states west of the Cong Ling Mountains were subject to this country. Because the land is linked with the territory of the Turks the people of this country are influenced by Turkish customs. They have to guard their own land against invasion and pillage so they wander about, leading a nomadic life in different regions. There are several tens of strong cities, each with its own ruler. The people live in domed felt tents and move from place to place, up to the border of the country of Krisma in the west.

Going east in a valley for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Badakshān. The country of Badakshān, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than two thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city, built on the cliff of a mountain, is six or seven _li_ in circuit. In this land there are mountains and valleys connected in a chain and the earth is covered with sand and stone. The soil is good for growing pulse and wheat and there is plenty of such fruit as grapes, walnuts, pears, and crabapples. The climate is fiercely cold and the people are staunch and violent by nature. They observe no etiquette and do not learn arts or crafts. Their features are ugly and vulgar and they mostly wear felt and hempen garments. There are three or four monasteries with very few monks. The king is a plain and honest man who deeply believes in the Triple Gem.

Going southeast from here in a valley for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Invakan. The country of Invakan, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than one thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over ten _li_ in circuit. It has a chain of mountains and valleys interspersed with narrow plains and cultivated land. The native products, climate, and the characteristics of the people are the same as in the country of Badakshān but the language differs slightly. The king is a tyrannical person who does not distinguish between good and evil.

From here going southeast, over mountains and across valleys for more than three hundred _li_ by perilous paths in the canyons, I reached the country of Kuraṇa. The country of Kuraṇa, an old territory of the country of Tukhāra, is more than two thousand _li_ in circuit. The land, topography, and climate are the same as in the country of Invakan. There are no legal institutions and the people are vulgar and violent by nature. Most do not perform meritorious deeds though a few of them believe in the buddha-dharma. Their features are ugly and unsightly and they mostly wear felt or hempen clothes. There is a rocky mountain from which much crystal is produced. The people break up the rocks to obtain the mineral. There are a small number of monasteries with few monks. The king is a plain and honest man who respects the Triple Gem.

From here going northeast, climbing over mountains and traversing valleys for more than five hundred _li_ on a hard and dangerous journey, I reached the country of Dharmasthiti (also called Zhenkan or Humi). The country of Dhar- masthiti, lying between two mountains, is an old territory of the country of Tukhāra. It is one thousand and five or six hundred _li_ from east to west and four or five _li_ wide; at its narrowest point it is less than one _li_ wide. It winds along the Oxus River. The land is uneven with mounds and hummocks and the earth is covered with shifting sand and stone; the cold wind is harsh and strong. Only wheat and pulse are planted; there are few trees and no flowers or fruit. The country produces many good horses, which, though small in size, are capable of undertaking hard journeys. The people have no sense of etiquette and righteousness. They are rustic and violent by nature, with ugly and unsightly features. Their garments are made of felt and hempen cloth and their eyes are of a dark green color, different from those of the people of other countries. There are more than ten monasteries with few monks.

The capital of this country is the city of Khamdādh, in which there is a monastery built by a former king of this country. The cliffs were cut to [make material] to fill up the gully in order to prepare the building site for the halls and houses of the monastery. Formerly this country was not Buddhist and the people worshiped only heretical gods. A few hundred years ago the Dharma began to spread in this country. The beloved son of the king of this country was once ill; the physicians were unable to cure him so his illness worsened. The king then went in person to a _deva_ temple to seek the help of the god. The priest in charge of the temple, speaking on the god’s behalf, said that the prince would surely be cured and there was no need to worry.

The king was pleased to hear this. On his way back home he met with a _śramaṇa_ who had a remarkable demeanor. Surprised to see the mendicant’s appearance and garments, the king inquired where he had come from. This _śramaṇa,_ who had realized sainthood, wished to spread the buddha-dharma and that was why he was dressed as he was. He answered the king, saying, “I am a disciple of the Tathāgata, a _bhikṣu,_ as people say.” Feeling worried in his mind, the king anxiously said to him, “My son is ill and in critical condition.” The _śramaṇa_ said, “Even though the spirits of your ancestors may be brought back to life it will be difficult to save your beloved son.” The king said, “The god has said that my son will not die, yet this _śramaṇa_ says that he is near his end. How can I believe the words of such a humbug?” When the king returned to his palace, however, he found that his son had died. The king kept it a secret and did not send out an obituary, but went to see the priest, who again assured him that his son would not die and his disease would be cured. The king, enraged, had the priest bound and rebuked him, saying, “You people live in a group doing a lot of evil and you cheat people with your influence to gain advantages. My son has already died yet you still say that he will be cured of his illness. Your fraudulence and deceit are intolerable. The priest should be put to death and the temple demolished.” The priest was killed and the image of the god was removed and thrown into the Oxus River. After that the king on the return journey and on the way he again met with the _śramaṇa._ He was glad to meet the mendicant, showed him respect, and paid homage to him, saying, “Formerly, I had no sagacious person to guide me and I set foot on the wrong path. Although it has been a long tradition it is time now for a reformation. I hope you will condescend to come to my residence.”

At the king’s invitation, the _śramaṇa_ accompanied him to the royal palace. After the prince’s burial the king said to him, “The human world is entan- glemed in the cycle of rebirth. When my son was ill I asked the god about his fate, and the god lied and said that my son would certainly be cured of his illness. Then I heard your information, which proved to be true. From this I know that your Dharma is believable. Please have pity on me and guide this deluded disciple.” He invited the _śramaṇa_ to make a plan for the construction of a monastery according to established rules. The temple of the old monastery was built for the arhat and since then the buddha-dharma began to flourish in this country.

In the great temple of the monastery is a stone image of the Buddha, over which a gilded copper canopy, adorned with various precious things, is suspended. Whenever someone pays homage to the Buddha’s image by circumambulating it the canopy also turns along with the worshiper; if the person stops and sands still, the canopy stops turning too. Nobody knows the cause of this mystery. I heard some old people say that the canopy is suspended by the willpower of a saint, or that it is operated by a mechanical device. I noticed that the stone walls of the hall were high and strong and I could not tell which of the stories was true.

Going north over a great mountain in this country, I reached the country of Sikni. The country of Sikni is more than two thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over five or six _li_ in circuit. Mountains and valleys connect together and sand and stone are spread all over the wilderness. The country produces much winter wheat but there are few other cereals. Trees are rare and flowers and fruit are scarce. The climate is very cold and the people are rustic and bold by custom, cruelly making slaughter and theft their profession. They do not know about ritual and righteousness and make no distinction between good and evil. They hold wrong ideas about future misfortune and happiness and fear disasters in their present life. Their features are vulgar and unsightly and they wear fur or hempen clothes. Their written language is the same as in the country of Tukhāra but they speak in a different way.

Going south over a great mountain in the country of Dharmasthiti, I reached the country of Shangmi. The country of Shangmi is two thousand and five or six hundred _li_ in circuit, with alternating mountains and valleys as well as high and low hills. All sorts of cereals are grown; pulse and wheat are particularly abundant. It yields a large amount of grapes and produces orpiment, which is obtained by breaking up rocks hewn from the cliffs. The mountain gods are fierce and malicious and have repeatedly caused calamities. Travelers may be safe and have a pleasant journey if they worship the gods with offerings before entering the mountains; otherwise they may encounter abrupt windstorms and hail. The climate is cold and the people are impetuous by custom but simple and honest in disposition. They have no idea of etiquette and righteousness. Their wisdom and resourcefulness are limited and their crafts are shallow and superficial. Their written language is the same as that of the country of Tukhāra but they speak in a different way. They mostly wear felt and hempen clothes. The king is of Sākya stock and respects the buddha-dharma; the people following his edification are all pure Buddhists. There are two monasteries with very few monks.

Going over mountains and across valleys, through dangerous regions in the northeast part of the country for more than seven hundred _li,_ I reached the Pamir Valley, which is more than one thousand _li_ from east to west and over one hundred _li_ from south to north; at its narrowest point it is less than ten _li_ wide. It is situated between two snowy mountains and a fierce and strong cold wind blows day and night. Snow falls in spring and summer. The soil is saline and has much gravel; it is uncultivable and so there are scarcely any plants. It is an empty and dreary place without human habitation.

In the Pamir Valley there is a great dragon lake that is more than three hundred _li_ firom east to west and over fifty _li_ from south to north. Lying among the ranges of the Cong Ling Mountains in the center of Jambudvīpa, this lake is in the highest position. The water is pure and clear, of unfathomable depth, and bluish-black in color with a very sweet and refreshing taste. In the water dwell sharks, hornless dragons, fish, normal dragons, soft-shelled turtles, alligators, and tortoises; floating on the water’s surface are mandarin ducks, swans, wild geese, and bustards. The huge eggs laid by various birds are left in the wilds among the marshes or on sandy islets.

The lake has a large outlet on the west side and water flows westward to the eastern boundary of the country of Dharmasthiti, where it joins the Oxus River and flows west. All streams on the right side of this point flow to the west. On the east of the lake, another large stream flows northeast to the western boundary of the country of Kasha, where it joins the Sītā River and flows east. All streams on the left side of this point flow to the east. Across a mountain in the south of the Pamir Valley is the country of Balura, where much gold and silver are produced; the gold is of a fiery color.

From this valley going southeast for more than five hundred _li,_ climbing over mountains by dangerous paths that are unihabitated all along the way and full of ice and snow, I reached the country of Kabhanda. The country of Kabhanda is more than two thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city, founded on a large rocky ridge with the Sītā River at its back, is over twenty _li_ in circuit. The mountains and ridges of the country connect together and the valleys and plains are small and narrow. There are few varieties of cereals but pulse and wheat are abundant. Trees are rare and flowers and Suit are scarce. The plains and swamps lie in waste and the cities and towns are desolate. The people have no idea of etiquette and righteousness by custom and seldom learn crafts. They are rustic and violent by nature but are valiant and brave as well. Their features are ugly and unsightly and they wear felt and hempen clothes. Their writing and spoken language are generally the same as in the country of Kasha. They have pure faith, however, and respect the buddha- dharma. There are over ten monasteries with more than five hundred monks, who study the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school. The present king is a simple and honest man who venerates the buddha-dharma. He has a composed and refined demeanor and is devoted to learning. Many years have elapsed since the establishment of the country. The king professed himself a descendant of Cīnadevagotra (Chinese, “Sun-god Stock”; see below).

Formerly the country was a wild valley in the ranges of the Cong Ling Mountains. In the past a Persian king once obtained a Chinese lady for his queen. As the bride was being taken to Persia she passed this place at a time when a rebellion was taking place. The road leading from east to west was blocked so the king’s bride was lodged on an isolated peak, so steep and lofty that ladders had to be used for going up and down. Guards were posted around the peak to keep watch day and night. After three months the uprising was quelled but when the bride was about to resume the journey she was found to be pregnant. The envoy who escorted her was terror-stricken and said to his followers, “The king ordered us to bring his bride back but we met with the revolt and remained in a precarious situation in the wilds, not knowing what would befall us. Thanks to the virtuous influence of our king, the insurgency has been put down. Now at this moment of resuming our return journey, the king’s bride is found to be with child. I am worried about the situation and do not know where I will die. We should find the chief culprit so that he can be put to death later.” They made a clamorous interrogation but could not find out the true criminal. At that moment the bride’s maidservant told the envoy, “Do not condemn anyone. Tthe pregnancy] is due to her union with a god. Every day at noon a man emerged from the disc of the sun and came to this place on horseback.” The envoy said, “If that is so, how can we free ourselves of the blame? If we go back we shall be put to death, but if we stay here troops will be sent to attack us. What shall we do in such an awkward predicament?” They all said, “This is not a trivial matter. Who would go willingly to suffer the punishment of death? We sgould instead pass our days abroad.”

So they built a palace and other houses on the top of a rocky peak, more than three hundred paces in circuit. They constructed a city wall around the palace and made the Chinese lady their queen. Officials were appointed and a legal system was established. When the time was came she gave birth to a son, who grew up into a handsome lad. He received the title of king and his mother acted as regent. He could fly about in the air and had control over the wind and clouds. His prestige and virtue spread far and his fame and edification extended to a great distance. All the neighboring regions and countries became his vassal states. When at length this king died at an old age his corpse was entombed in a cave in the mountains over one hundred _li_ southeast of the capital. The corpse has become a mummy and is still intact, resembling an emaciated figure that seems to be fast asleep. Its garments are changed from time to time and sweet flowers are always placed before it by his descendants from generation to generation up to the present time. Because their maternal ancestor was a Chinese lady and on the paternal side he was the sun god, they claimed to be descendants of Chinese-sun-god stock. The facial features of the members of the royal clan are similar to those of Chinese people and they wear square caps, but they dress in the attire of the Hu people. Their offspring degenerated and suffered oppression from powerful countries.

When King Aśoka prospered in the world he built a stupa in the palace, and the king [of this country] went to live in the northeast corner of the palace. He converted his old palace into a monastery for the venerable _śāstra_ master Kumaralāta. The terraces and pavilions were lofty and spacious and solemn images of the Buddha were installed in them. The venerable monk, a native of the country of Takṣaśilā, was intelligent since childhood and renounced the world at an early age to engage in the study of the scriptures and fix his mind on the abstruse doctrines. Every day he recited thirty-two thousand words and wrote them down as well. Thus he was prominent in learning among contemporary scholars and enjoyed a high reputation in his time. He upheld the right Dharma and crashed erroneous views; in his brilliant discussions there was no question he could not answer. He was greatly esteemed in all of the five parts of India. His writings amounted to several tens of books, all of which were popular works studied by all scholars. He was the founder of the Sautrāntika school. In his time, Aśvaghoṣa in the east, Deva in the south, Nāgāṇuna in the west, and Kumaralāta in the north were called the Four Brilliant Suns. Hearing of this venerable monk’s great fame, the king of this country mobilized his troops, attacked the country of Takṣaśilā, and captured him. It was out of respect for him that this monastery was constructed.

More than three hundred _li_ away to the southeast of the capital is a great rocky cliff with two caves. In each cave an arhat entered the _samādhi_ of complete extinction, sitting erect and immovable in the shape of an emaciated man, and their skin and skeletons are undecayed. They have been there for more than seven hundred years. Their hair continues to grow so the monks shave their hair and change their garments once a year.

From the great cliff going northeast over ranges by a dangerous path for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached Puṇyaśālā (“Charity House”), located at the center of a depression about one hundred _qing_ in area (1 _qing_ = 6.67 hectares). It is surrounded by four mountains of the eastern ridges of the Cong Ling Mountains. Snow accumulates in winter as well as in the summer season and the cold wind blows hard and strong. The land is of saline soil and does not grow crops. There are no trees, only short grasses. Even in the hot season snowstorms are likely to occur. On entering this region travelers may be immediately enshrouded by clouds and mist. This is a dangerous place, dreaded by traveling merchants. I heard some old people say that once in the past a large group of merchants, with several thousand camels laden with goods to gain profit, encountered a snowstorm at this place and all the people and animals lost their lives. At that time a great arhat in the country of Kabhanda saw the catastrophe from a distance. Having pity on the merchants caught in danger, he intended to rescue them through his supernatural power but when he arrived at the spot the merchants were already dead. So he collected the jewels and valuables and all their property and built a house in which he stored various commodities. He also purchased a piece of land in the neighboring country to make a settlement in the frontier city and hired people to live there to look after travelers. At present all wayfarers and merchants are provided with daily necessaries at this place.

From here going eastward down the eastern ridges of the Cong Ling Mountains, climbing over perilous ranges and across deep valleys, through dangerous paths in the gorges, and braving continuous wind and snow, I proceeded for more than eight hundred _li_ and emerged from the Cong Ling range, arriving in the country of Wusha. The country of Wusha is more than one thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city is over ten _li_ in circuit. It borders on the Sītā River in the south and the land is fertile, producing abundant crops. The trees are luxuriant with plenty of flowers and fruit. It yields much jade of different hues, such as white, jet[-black], and sapphire. The climate is mild with good weather favorable for the growth of crops. The people lack etiquette and righteousness and are strong-willed and rustic in disposition; they are deceitful and have little sense of shame. Their written and spoken language are somewhat similar to those of the country of Kasha. Their features are ugly and unsightly and their clothes are made of fur and hemp. They believe in and respect the buddha-dharma, however. There are some ten monasteries with less than a thousand monks, who study the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school. The royal lineage has been extinct for several hundred year so this country has no sovereign ruler and is subject to the country of Kabhanda.

Going westward from the capital for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached a great mountain where the mists of the mountain rises high and turns into clouds upon touching the rocks. The precipices are lofty and steep, as if they were broken, and they seemed likely to collapse at any moment. The stupa built at the summit affords a splendid sight. I heard some local people say that several hundred years ago a cliff of the mountain collapsed and exposed a _bhikṣu_ sitting with closed eyes behind the rocks. He was tall in stature but appeared to be emaciated. His beard and hair covered his face and shoulders. A hunter saw him and reported the case to the king. The king came in person to see and worship the _bhikṣu,_ and the inhabitants and officials in the capital also came of their own accord to vie with one another in offering incense and flowers. The king asked, “Who is this man, so tall in stature?” A _bhikṣu_ said in reply, “This man with long beard and hair, clad in religious robes, is an arhat absorbed in the _samādhi_ of mental extinction. One who is absorbed in such a _samādhi_ has prelimited the duration of the trance. He may be aroused by the sound of a musical instrument or by the shining of sunlight; with such signals he may be awakened from the abstract meditation. If there is no disturbance he will remain motionless. The power of _samādhi_ sustains his body from decaying but when he has come out of the _samādhi_ his physical body, which is composed of food, may become feeble and fragile. We should infuse him with ghee to nurture his body before we awaken him from the mental concentration.” The king said, “Let it be so!”

A musical instrument was then struck. As soon as the instrument was sounded the arhat awakened and, after looking around for awhile, he said, “Who are you, of such base appearance and wearing religious robes?” The monk said, “I am a _bhikṣu.”_ The arhat said, “Where is my teacher, Kāśyapa Tathāgata?” The monk said, “He entered _mahānirvāṇa_ a long time ago.” Hearing this, the arhat closed his eyes, disappointed. He then asked, “Has Śākyamuni Tathāgata come into the world yet?” The monk said in reply, “He has passed away after having been born into the world to guide living beings.” When the arhat had heard this information he lowered his head. After a long while he ascended into the air and cremated himself with fire produced through his supernatural power, and his ashes dropped to the ground. The king collected them and built a stupa for them.

Going northward from here for more than five hundred _li_ over mountains and through deserts and wilderness, I reached the country of Kasha (formerly called Shule, the name of the capital city. To be correct, it should be called Śrīkrītati, which indicates that the name Shule [for the country] is apparently wrong). The country of Kasha is more than five thousand _li_ in circuit, consisting mostly of desert with little cultivable land. Crops are abundant and there are plenty of flowers and fruit. It produces fine felt and hemp, as well as exquisitely woven cotton cloth and woolen carpets. The climate is mild and the weather changes according to the seasons. The people are rustic and violent by nature and deceitful by custom. They have little sense of etiquette and righteousness and their learning is superficial. It is their custom to compress the heads of their newborn babies into a flat shape. They are vulgar and coarse in appearance, tattoo their bodies, and have green eyes. Their written language evolved after the fashion of the language of India. Although there are deletions and aberrations, the linguistic structure and function are mainly preserved. The diction and accent of their dialect differ from those of other countries. They piously believe in the buddha-dharma and diligently perform meritorious deeds. There are several hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks who study the Sarvās- tivāda school of the Hinayana teachings. The monks do not delve into the doctrines but they can recite by heart most of the texts. Therefore many of them are reciters of the Tripiṭaka and the _Mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra._

From here going southeast for more than five hundred _li,_ crossing the Sītā River and a great sandy range, I reached the country of Cukuka (formerly called Juqu). The country of Cukuka is more than one thousand _li_ in circuit and its capital city, which is over ten _li_ in circuit, is in an impregnable position with a large number of registered inhabitants. There is a chain of mountains and hillocks covered with stone and gravel. Two rivers wind through the country so the land is good for cultivation. Such fruit as grapes, pears, and crabapples are abundant. The seasonal wind is cold. The people are rude and deceitful by custom and robbery is committed openly. Their writing is similar to that of Gostana (see below) but the spoken language is different. They have little sense of etiquette and righteousness and their learning is superficial, but they piously believe in the Triple Gem and are fond of performing meritorious deeds. There are several tens of monasteries, most of which are in ruins. The monks, about a hundred in number, study Mahayana teachings.

In the southern part of this country there is a great mountain with lofty peaks and ranges standing one behind the other. The grass and trees are cold- resistant and they are always the same, whether in spring or autumn. The streams in the gullies flow rapidly in all directions. On the cliffs there are caves and rock cells scattered all over the precipices. Many Indians who achieved sainthood came here from a great distance through their supernatural power of levitation and settled in this place. Many of the arhats died here, so a large number of stupas have been built in the mountain. There are still three arhats living in the caves, absorbed in the _samādhi_ of mental extinction. They look emaciated but their beards and hair continue to grow, so the monks go to shave them regularly. A large number of Mahayana scriptures in particular are stored in this country; of all the places where Buddhism has prevailed none can surpass this country in its collection of scriptures. Books consisting of a hundred thousand stanzas each amount to more than ten titles, and those of fewer stanzas are widely circulated indeed.

Going eastward from there for more than eight hundred _li_ over ranges and across valleys, I reached the country of Gostana (this name is the elegant form of the local dialect, meaning “earth-nipple.” In the vulgar language it is called Huanna, while the Huns call it Yudun. In the other Hu language it is designated as Qidan, and in India it is named Qudan. Its old form, Yutian, is incorrect). The country of Gostana is more than four thousand _li_ in circuit and more than half the country is desert. There is only a limited area of cultivable land, which yields cereals and diverse kinds of fruit. The country produces woolen carpets and fine felt and the people are skillful in spinning and weaving silk. It also yields white and black jade. The climate is pleasant but there are dust whirls. The people have a sense of etiquette and righteousness and are genial and polite in disposition. They are fond of learning the classics and the arts and they are conversant with various crafts. The common people are wealthy and happy and the registered families live in peace and security. The state promotes music and the people love singing and dancing. A few of them wear woolen, hempen, felt, or fur clothes, but the majority use silk and white cotton for their clothing. They are graceful in deportment and well disciplined in behavior. Their system of writing follows that of India, with slight alterations and some reforms; their spoken language differs from that of other countries. They esteem the buddha-dharma and there are over a hundred monasteries with more than five thousand monks who mostly study Mahayana teachings. The king is a very brave man and holds the buddha-dharma in high esteem. He claims to be a descendant of the deity Vaiśravaṇa.

In the past the deity Vaiśravaṇa stayed here when this country was uninhabited. After King Aśoka’s prince had his eyes gouged out in the country of Takṣaśilā, the king angrily reproached his ministers and exiled some of the powerful and influential families to settle in the desert valleys to the north of the Snow Mountains. In the course of moving from place to place in search of pasture, the exiled people came to the western region of this country and elected their leader as king. Meanwhile, one of the sons of the emperor of a land in the east was condemned to banishment and went to live in the eastern region of this country. At the instigation of his followers he made himself king. For a long time the two kings were not in contact with one another. Once, when both men were out hunting, they met in the wilderness and each inquired of the other about his ancestral lineage. They then had a dispute over the question of who was superior in rank. The argument became more heated and they were soon on the brink of resorting to force. Someone advised them, “Why should we fight a decisive battl while out hunting, when we have not fully mobilized our troops? We should go back to arrange our fighters in battle array and then make an appointment to meet again.” So the two kings returned to their respective countries, had their soldiers drill and practice the arts of war, and boosted their morale. On the appointed day the two armies met on the battleground, with colors flying and drums beating, and the following day they engaged. The lord from the west was defeated and while attempting to retreat he was decapitated. The lord from the east comforted and assembled the inhabitants of the defeated country on his victorious march. He moved his capital to the central part of the country and planned to build city walls. He was concerned about not knowing where the ground was clay and feared that his plan would not succeed, so he made an announcement to invite learned soil scientists from far and near. An ash-smearing ascetic carrying a big calabash of water approached to recommend himself to the king, saying, “I know the structure of soil.” He dripped the water to mark the ground in a roundabout way twice and then departed and disappeared. The foundations of the city walls were laid down along the water marks and the city became the seat of government. The present king has made his capital in this city. Although it is not in a high and invulnerable position it is strong and difficult for attackers to capture. Since ancient times no one has ever occupied it in a war.

By the time the king had moved his capital to the newly built city for the establishment of his government and the settlement of his people, he was already getting old, after many achievements and exploits. He was childless and feared that his ancestral line would die out, so he went to the place of the deity Vaiśravaṇa to pray for a son and a baby burst out from the forehead of the image of the deity. The king carried the baby home, to the delight of the whole country. The baby refused to drink milk, however, and the king feared that it might not live long. So he went again to the temple to seek nourishment for the baby. The earth in front of the deity’s image suddenly bulged into the shape of a nipple, from which the baby drew milk [and he received nourishment in this way] until he grew up. He became an unprecedentedly brave and brilliant man whose influence spread far and he renovated the temple in honor of his forefather. Since then the royal lineage has continued from generation to generation without cessation. That is why the temple is frill of jewels and gems and ceremonies of worship and sacrifice are regularly offered to the deity without neglect. Because their ancestor was nursed with milk from an earth-nipple, the people named their country after it.

About ten _li_ to the south of the royal city is a great monastery built by a previous king of this country for the arhat Vairocana (“Universal Shining” in Chinese). Formerly, when the buddha-dharma had not yet spread to this country, the arhat came here and stayed in the wood, sitting in meditation. Someone saw him and was amazed by his appearance and garments. He reported the matter to the king, who came in person to see the arhat and said, “Who are you, staying alone in the solitary wood?” The arhat said, “I am a disciple of the Tathāgata and I live alone, practicing meditation. O King, you should perform meritorious deeds to propagate the Buddha’s teachings and build a monastery for the assembly of monks.” The king said, “What are the virtues of the Tathāgata and what divine powers does he possess that made you dwell like a bird in the wood and practice his teachings so assiduously?” The arhat said in reply, “The Tathāgata has compassion for all creatures of the four kinds of birth and guides all living beings of the three realms, either overtly or covertly, in the states of existence or extinction. Those who follow his Dharma will become free of birth and death, while those who do not believe in it will be entangled in the net of passion.” The king said, “Truly, as you have said, this matter is beyond verbal discussion. Since he is a great saint he may as well appear in physical form so that I might see him. Once I have seen him I will build a monastery, believe in him as my refuge, and propagate his teachings.” The arhat said, “After you have completed the construction of a monastery you will receive his spiritual response.” Hopeful, the king agreed to build the monastery. When the construction was completed people from far and near assembled to celebrate the occasion as a religious function, but they lacked the instrument to be sounded for summoning the monks. The king said to the arhat, “Now the monastery is completed but where is the Buddha?” The arhat said, “Work with utmost sincerity; the holy evidence is not far off.” The king then prayed and worshiped and suddenly an image of the Buddha descended from the air and handed an instrument to him. Thereafter the king piously believed in the Buddha and propagated his teachings.

More than twenty _li_ to the southwest of the royal city is Gośṛṅga (“Cowhorn”) Mountain, with two high eaks surrounded by precipitous cliffs. In the valley a monastery was constructed, in which the Buddha’s image often emitted a bright light. In the past the Tathāgata once came here and briefly preached the essence of the Dharma to human and heavenly beings. He prophesied that a country would be founded here and that the people would revere his teachings and follow Mahayana tenets. Amid the rocks of Cowhorn Mountain there is a large cave in which an arhat is absorbed in the meditation of mental extinction, waiting for the advent of Maitreya Buddha. For several hundred years offerings have been made to him without cease. Recently the rocks collapsed and blocked the entrance to the cave. The king sent his soldiers to clear away the fallen stones but a swarm of black wasps flew out to sting them. Thus up to now the entrance has not been reopened.

About ten _li_ to the southwest of the royal city is Dīrghabhāvana Monastery, in which there is a standing image of the Buddha, made of ramie and lacquer, that came by itself to this place from the country of Kuci. A cabinet minister of this country was once banished to live in Kuci and while he was in exile he always worshiped this image. After he was recalled to his own country he continued to recall and venerate the image from afar. One night the image suddenly came to him. The man offered his residence for the construction of this monastery.

Going westward from the royal city for more than three hundred _li,_ I reached the city of Bhagya. In this city is an image of the seated Buddha, about seven feet in height, with consummate features, quiet and dignified, and with a precious crown on its head that occasionally emits a bright light. I heard the local people say that this image was originally in the country of Kaśmīra and had been transported to its present location. In the past a _śrā- maṇera,_ the disciple of an arhat, once desired to eat some fermented rice cake when he was on his deathbed. The arhat saw with his supernatural power of clairvoyance that this kind of cake was obtainable in the country of Gostana, so he went there through his faculty of divine feet and obtained some of the cake for his disciple. Having eaten the cake, the _śrāmaṇera_ wished to be reborn in that country after death. His wish was actually fulfilled and he was reborn as a prince of [Gostana], After his succession to the throne his prestige spread far and near., and later he crossed the Snow Mountains to invade the country of Kaśmīra. The king of Kaśmīra had concentrated his troops to resist the invaders at the frontier but the arhat exhorted him, “There is no need to resort to force. I can repulse them.” The arhat then went to speak on the essence of various Dharmas to the king of Gostana. At first the king would not listen to him and still wanted to send his army to the battleground. The arhat then produced the robe that the king had worn in his previous life as the _śrāmaṇera._ At the sight of the robe the king gained the supernatural faculty of remembering past events. He apologized to the king of Kaśmīra and withdrew his troops after reconciliation. He also brought back with his army the Buddha’s image that he had worshiped when he was a _śrāmaṇera_ in his former life. When the image was brought to this place it refused to be moved any further, and so a monastery was built to enshrine the image where it stood. Monks were invited to live in the monastery and the king’s precious crown was placed on head of the image. The present crown on the image’s head is the one that was offered by the previous king.

Along the main path, in a great desert one hundred and fifty or sixty _li_ to the west of the royal city, are mounds that are actually heaps of earth dug out by rats from their holes. I heard the local people say that the rats in the desert were as large as hedgehogs, that the ones with golden or silvery hair were the chiefs, and that each time they came out of their holes the other rats always followed them as attendants. The Hun people once led hundreds of thousands of troops to attack the frontier [of Gostana] and they were stationed beside the rat mounds. At that time the king of Gostana had only a few tens of thousands of soldiers under his command and he feared that his army was not strong enough to resist the enemy. He always knew that the rats in the desert were marvelous animals but he did not regard them as divine beings. When the invaders arrived both the monarch and his subjects were greatly surprised and did not know how to deal with the situation. As a temporary expedient they tried conducting a sacrificial ceremony, praying to the rats in the hope that they might help strengthen the army. That night the king of Gostana dreamed that a giant rat said to him, “I wish to assist you and I hope you will get your men ready for battle at an early hour. If you engage the enemy tomorrow you will certainly win the day.” Knowing that he had spiritual assistance, the king of Gostana mobilized his troops and ordered them to launch a surprise attack before dawn. The Hun invaders were frightened when they heard of this. They rushed to put on their armor and mount the horses and chariots, but they found that the saddles and equipment, the strings of their bows and ties for the armor, and all such belts and cords had been gnawed through by the rats. The defenders then arrived suddely and the Hun people were overcome and suffered capture and massacre; the commanders were killed and the soldiers taken prisoner. The Hun people, thinking that their opponents had the help of divine beings, were awestruck. Out of gratitude toward the rats the king of Gostana built a temple to offer sacrifices to them, and this tradition has been carried down from generation to generation with a deep and special feeling of wonderment. From the monarch on down to common citizens, everyone performed sacrificial ceremonies to gain blessedness. Whenever they passed by the rat holes they alighted from their horses and carriages to worship the rats and offer clothing, bows, and arrows or fragrant flowers and delicious food to them, so as to pray for happiness. Because they did so with sincerity they gained benefit in most cases. If no sacrifice was offered one might meet with calamity.

Five or six _li_ to the west of the royal city is Samājñā Monastery, in which there is a stupa more than a hundred feet high that shows frequent spiritual signs and occasionally emits a divine light. In the past an arhat once came from a distance and stayed in the wood, issuing a bright light through his supernatural power. From a storied pavilion the king saw the light shining brightly in the wood at night and asked his attendants about it, and they all said, “A _śramaṇa_ has come from a distance and is now sitting in the wood, manifesting his supernatural powers.” The king then ordered his driver to prepare his carriage and went in person to see the monk. When he saw the sage he cherished a feeling of respect for him and, in admiration of the monk’s demeanor, the king invited him to come to the palace. The _śramaṇa_ said, “Everything has its own appropriate position and each person has his particular inclination. A secluded wood with marshes and streams is the place I appreciate, while lofty halls and grand mansions are not what I should accept.” The king respected him all the more and treated him with even greater honor. A monastery was built with a stupa, and the _śramaṇa_ was invited to stay there.

Before long, to his great delight the king obtained several hundred grains of relic bones through his profound devotion. He regretted that the relics, as a spiritual response, had come a bit too late to have been enshrined in the stupa, which would consequently have become a superior holy site. He went to the monastery and told his idea to the monks. The arhat said, “O King, do not worry! I can place the relics under the stupa for you. You should put the relics in golden, silver, copper, iron, and stone cases, one by one.” The king ordered craftsmen to make the required cases and they completed the task in a few days’ time. The cases were sent to the monastery in precious carriages and hundreds of heralds, attendants, and officials from the palace escorted the relics, while tens of thousands of people watched the procession. The arhat lifted up the stupa with his right hand and placed it in his palm, saying to the king, “You may place the relics now.” Then the ground was dug up for the cases and when this had been done, the stupa was replaced on the site without any damage or slanting. Those who witnessed the event said in admiration that they had never before seen such a sight; then faith in the Buddha became even more sincere and then minds of respecting the Dharma more steadfast.

The king said to his group of officials, “I have heard that the Buddha’s power is inconceivable and his divine faculties are unfathomable. He can appear in hundreds of myriads of bodies simultaneously and take birth either in the human world or in heaven. He can lift up the world in his palm without making living beings feel any agitation. He expounded the nature of the Dharma in normal language to enable all creatures to reach enlightenment in different ways, according to theft varying capacities. His divine power is incomparable and his wisdom is beyond description. Although his corporeal form has vanished his teachings have been handed down, so that we can enjoy the peace of his doctrine, live under the influence of his virtue, taste the flavor of the Way, and admire his characteristic way of life. Owing to his blessing, we have now obtained these holy relics. Do your utmost, all of you, to pay deep respect to the Buddha. You will then understand that the buddha-dharma is abstruse and profound.”

Five or six _li_ to the southeast of the royal city is Maza Monastery, which was established by a concubine of a former king of this country. In the past neither the mulberry tree or silkworms were known in this country. Hearing that a certain country in the east had mulberry trees and silkworms, [the king] dispatched a messenger to seek for them, but the monarch of the eastern country kept them hidden and would not grant the request. He gave orders to the frontier guards to prevent mulberry seeds or silkworms from being smuggled out of the country. The king of Gostana then humbly proposed to enter into a matrimonial alliance with the eastern country. The king of the eastern country had ambitions to exert his influence over distant lands through mollification, so he readily agreed to the proposal. The king of Gostana appointed an envoy to collect the bride and said to him, “Tell the daughter of the monarch of the eastern country that we have no silk thread, nor do we have we mulberry trees or silkworms, in our country. Ask her to bring some seeds with her [so that silk may be produced] to make garments for her.” Hearing this, the daughter of the monarch secretly obtained some mulberry seeds and silkworms, which she hid inside the cloth of her hat. When she arrived at the frontier the guards searched all her belongings but they dared not inspect her hat. In this manner she entered the country of Gostana and lodged at the place where Maza Monastery now stands. She was then taken to the royal palace with proper rites and ceremony and the mulberry seeds and silkworms were kept at the palace. In early spring the mulberry seeds were planted, and in the month of breeding silkworms the leaves of the mulberry trees were plucked to feed them. In the early stages [the silkworms] were also fed with leaves of miscellaneous trees. From then on the mulberry trees thrived, their luxuriant foliage casting shadows in patches. The king’s concubine made an inscription on a stone tablet to lay down a rule forbidding people from harming the silkworms. Only when the silk moths had all flown away could the cocoons be reeled; the gods would not protect those who dared infringe this rule. This monastery was built in memory of the first group of silkworms. There are several withered mulberry trees, said to be the first mulberries planted there. Silkworms are not killed in this country and if anyone stealthily reels silk [from cocoons with larvae inside] he will reap a poor harvest in sericulture the following year.

More than one hundred _li_ to the southeast of the [royal] city is a large river flowing northwest, which the people use for irrigation. At one time it dried up, to the great surprise of the king. He rode in his carriage to inquire of an arhat monk, saying, “The water of the large river is usually drawn and used by the people; what is the fault that has caused it to dry up? Have I been unjust in managing state affairs, have my virtuous deeds not extended to all? If not, then why is the punishment from above so severe?” The arhat said, “Your Majesty rules the country in peace and good order. The drying up of the river is caused by the dragon [in the river]. It befits Your Majesty to immediately offer sacrifice and say prayers to him, and then the lost advantages may be recovered.” The king returned to his palace and performed a sacrificial ceremony for the dragon in the river. Suddenly a woman came over the waves and said to the king, “My husband has been dead for a long time and I am unable to carry out your order. That is why the river has dried up and the farmers have lost the advantage of irrigation. If you will select one of your noble ministers to be my husband the river’s waters will flow as usual.” The king said, “Please do as you wish.” The dragon [woman] looked at the ministers and was delighted with one of them. After returning to the palace the king said to his ministers, “My ministers are the pillars of the state and agriculture is the source of the food that sustains our lives. If I lose my ministers the state will be endangered, but without food all of us will die. What shall I choose, the endangerment of the state or death?” The minister [chosen by the dragon woman] arose from his seat and kneeled, saying in reply, “I am an incompetent person who is unworthy of my important position, and I have always thought of dedicating myself to the service of my country but have not yet had the chance. Now, having been selected [to take up the appointment], how could I dare refuse to bear this important responsibility? If it is for the benefit of the masses of people, there is no need to be reluctant about sending away a minister. A minister is merely an assistant of the state, while the people are the foundation of the country. I hope Your Majesty will hesitate no more. I would be fortunate if a monastery can be constructed as a good deed done on my behalf.” The king consented to his request and the work was completed in no time.

The minister then asked permission to go to the dragon’s palace at an early date. All the officials and common people in the whole country held farewell banquets in his honor, accompanied by the performance of music. The minister, dressed in white and riding a white horse, bade farewell to the king and expressed thanks to his countrymen before he rode into the river. The horse walked on the surface of the water without sinking. When it came to midstream the minister waved his whip to slice the water and made an opening, through which he dropped into the river. After a short while the white horse floated out of the river, carrying a sandalwood drum on its back along with a letter, which said in brief, “Your Majesty did not despise me as a humble person and gave me the chance to be selected by the goddess. I hope you will perform more meritorious deeds for the benefit of your country and people. The big drum is to be hung to the southeast of the city. Before the approach of invaders it will sound by itself to give warning.” Since then water has flowed in the river and the people have made use of it up to now. After such a the long lapse of time the original dragon drum is no longer in existence. At the place where it was hung another drum has been put as a substitute. The monastery beside the pond is deserted and in ruins, and there are no monks living there.

More than three hundred _li_ to the east of the royal city is a large expanse of marshland several tens of _qing_ in area, the earth of which is reddish-black in color; it supports no vegetation whatsoever. I heard some old people say that this was the place where the army [of this country] was defeated. In the past a country in the east once raised a million troops to make an invasion to the west. At that time the king of Gostana prepared an army several _lakhs_ strong to resist the enemy from the east. The two armies met at this place and engaged in battle and the soldiers of the west were defeated by the troops from the east. The latter, advancing in the flush of victory, slaughtered people cruelly, captured the king [of Gostana], killed his generals, and massacred the soldiers, sparing not a single one. The ground was stained with blood and the traces are still visible.

Going eastward for more than thirty _li_ from the battleground, I reached the city of Bhīmā, in which there is a standing image of the Buddha carved out of sandalwood, over twenty feet high, which has shown spiritual responses many times and often emits a bright light. If someone who suffers from a painful ailment pastes a piece of gold foil on the image at the part that corresponds to where his ailment is, he may be instantly relieved of the pain. If someone says prayers to the image with earnest devotion their wishes will be fulfilled in most cases. I heard the local people say that this image was made by King Udayana of the country of Kauśāmbī when the Buddha was living in the world. After the Buddha’s demise the image came through the air from that country to the city of Araurak in the north of this country [of Gostana].

The inhabitants of this city were living in happy and wealthy conditions and were deeply attached to erroneous views so when the image first came to the city they did not treasure or respect it. Even though they heard that it had come by itself they merely regarded this as a miracle and did not venerate the image as an unusual object of worship. An arhat later came to worship this image and the people, amazed at his strange garb, hurriedly went to report this to the king, who then ordered them to throw sand and earth on the strange person. The arhat was covered with sand and earth and no food was provided to him. At that time a man who always worshiped the image with veneration could not bear to see the arhat being starved and secretly offered him food. When the arhat was about to leave he told the man, “Seven days from now a sandstorm will cover the entire city and no one will remain alive. You should know this and prepare an esacpe for yourself. This disaster will occur because the people cast sand and earth on me.” After saying this the arhat departed and immediately disappeared.

That man entered the city and warned his relatives and friends, but those who heard the information sneered at him. On the following day a big gale swiftly arose and blew away the filthy dust, while various kinds of gems and precious substances rained down all over the roads and thoroughfares. The people then berated their informant all the more, but the man knew that disaster was a certainty and secretly excavated a tunnel leading out of the city and made it into a cellar. After midnight on the seventh day sand and earth rained from the air and filled up the city. The man escaped through the tunnel and went east to this country [of Gostana], where he stayed in the city of Bhīmā. No sooner had he arrived than the image also came to that place, where it was worshiped with offerings and no one dared remove it. I heard a prophet say that by the end of Śākyamuni’s Dharma the image will enter the dragon’s palace.

The city of Araurak has now become a big mound. Kings and powerful persons of many countries have attempted to excavate the precious treasure, but each time they have come to the side of the mound a strong, violent gale has arisen, raising a shroud of dust and clouds in which they lose their way.

From the east of the valley of Bhīmā I entered a desert. After going for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached the city of Nina, which is three or four _li_ in circuit, situated in a vast marsh. The marsh is hot and humid and it is difficult to pass through it. This region is overgrown with reeds and wild grass and has no tracks or paths. Because this is the only passageway leading to the city travelers have to go leave and depart by this way. Gostana made this city a frontier station in its eastern region. Going east from there I entered the Great Desert, in which the shifting sand is piled up and scatters with the wind. No trace of wayfarers can remain visible on the sand and travelers often lose their way in the vast wilderness and do not know which direction to go, so they have collected the skeletons of the dead to serve as landmarks. Water and pasture are scarce in the desert and the wind is hot; whenever the hot wind blows people and animals fall into a swoon and become ill. The sound of singing and shouting, or wailing and crying, is sometimes heard but when one looks around to locate the source of the sound no one can tell where it comes from. This phenomenon often causes death, as it is mischief wrought by ghosts and devils.

Going further for more than four hundred _li,_ I reached the old country of Tukhāra, which has been deserted for a long time; all the cities are in mins. From here proceeding to the east for more than six hundred _li,_ I reached the old country of Calmadana, the land of Jumo. The lofty city walls are still there but there is no trace of human habitation. Continuing my journey toward the northeast for more than one thousand _li,_ I reached the old country of Navāp, namely, the land of Lulan.

The purpose of composing this book has been to describe the mountains and valleys [of the Western Regions], to investigate and collect data on the conditions in different lands, to narrate in detail the upright and variable customs of various countries, and to record the climatic and topographic situations of diverse locales. As circumstances were always changing I laid emphasis on different points at different times. Although it was difficult for me to trace the origin of everything I described by no means did I resort to conjecture or fabrication, but I could write only in a brief manner about what I saw or heard on my journey and keep a record of the spread of the edification of Buddhism. Up to the place where the sun sets all people live under the beneficence of the Emperor, whose ultimate virtue is admired by all within the reach of his moral influence. The entire empire is a great unity and the world is the manifestation of oneness. Am I merely a solitary envoy going in a single carriage, passing through travelers’ rest stations for a distance of ten thousand _li._

*Eulogy of the Buddha*

The _Eulogy_ says: Great is the King of the Dharma, who appeared in the world with his spiritual edification working secretly and his divine Way leading to emptiness. His form and mentality disappeared in as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, and he ceased to rise and fall for _kalpas_ as innumerable as atoms in the world. As his form and mentality have disappeared his birth has no reality of birth, because as he has ceased to rise and fall his extinction has nothing of extinction. Could his birth in Kapilavastu have been a real fact? His passing away between the _śāla_ trees was merely a means of his secret edification. We should know that he manifested his traces in the world at opportune moments in accordance with circumstances to show the effect of his spirituality.

He was born in a Sākya family of the _kṣatriya_ caste. He should have succeeded to the throne of his native country but he devoted his life to religious activities. He gave up the prospect of being a universal monarch of the golden wheel and preferred to rale over the world of the Dharma; from the white curl between his eyebrows he emitted a light to comfort all living beings. His Way prevails in the ten directions and his wisdom comprehends everything. Even though he is from the unknowable universe he provides shelter to those who are in the discernible world. He turned the wheel of the Dharma of the three classifications in the great chiliocosm and expounded his doctrine in one and the same voice to teach the masses. His teachings are classified into eighty-four thousand gates, the essence of which is summed up in the twelve divisions of the scriptures. Therefore, wherever they are under the protection of his teachings the people can move about freely in the field of blessedness, and wherever they are inspired by his morals and discipline all people live in the land of longevity. Glorious are his saintly and sagacious deeds and perfect is his goodness toward human and heavenly beings! He gave up both mobility and immobility in the grove of _śāla_ trees and nullified the conception of coming and going in illusory existence, and no one could succeed him to glorify his doctrine of emptiness.

In order to repay the kindness of the Buddha, Venerable Mahākāśyapa selected a group of arhats to collect the precious Dharma, consisting of the four Āgamas explaining its origin and ramifications and the Tripiṭaka, which gives its essential theories. Although various schools and sects have arisen the essence of the great Dharma remains unchanged. From his birth up to his demise [the Buddha] showed a thousand transformations of his holy traces and manifested propitious omens in ten thousand ways. His limitless spirituality became more and more apparent and his teachings of nonaction were always pine and fresh. All these have been preserved in the scriptures and written down in the records and commentaries. Different opinions became confused and tangled, however, and dissidents spread their own diverse views. The original and fundamental theories are rarely interpreted in the correct way. There are many variant views even in the writings that are based on concrete facts, let alone in the texts that deal with the abstruse and profound right Dharma and that delve into the deep meanings of the abstract and recondite principles, where there are many incomplete points in exposition. This is because previous sages of virtue remained only in the track of translation and brilliant scholars of later times followed the course shown by incomplete texts. Thus the great doctrine was hidden in obscurity and the subtle sayings were missing and unknown to the world.

The teachings of the Dharma have been spreading for many years. Beginning with the Han dynasty and up to the present reign of the Tang, the glorious task of translation has been carried on in a fluent and graceful manner, as splendidly as the conjoined shining of the sun and moon. Tthe abstruse Way was not revealed in its entirety, however, and the true essence was still obscure. This was not because the holy teachings were sometimes active and other times inactive but simply due to untimely royal patronage.

Since the Great Tang has held sway over the empire it has won the confidence of foreign countries. The old rules formulated by the saints have been scrutinized and the outdated codes laid down by former monarchs amended. The teachings of the image period of Buddhism are exuberantly expounded as great instructions. The Way does not exist in vain but its propagation depends on the illustration of virtue. This is why the abstruse doctrines of the three vehicles were buried in oblivion for the last thousand years, and the spiritual efficacy of the Buddha’s ten powers of wisdom were shut out ten thousand _li_ away. It is true that the divine Way has no directional limitations in its spread, but the holy teachings have to depend on circumstances for their appearance.

*Eulogy of Xuanzang*

The genealogical origin of Dharma master Xuanzang may be traced back to Emperor Shun, who once fished at Leize and later married the two daughters of Emperor Yao at the Gui River, and whose descendants adopted the surname Chen. He is the embodiment of the good omen of superior virtue and contains the perfection of medium harmony. He follows the right Way in accordance with virtue and abides by chastity to rectify his behavior. Because he planted the cause of blessedness in his previous birth he was reborn into this life during a time of prosperity. His conduct surpassed that of the world and he stayed quietly in learning centers to receive the correct instructions taught by former teachers and to admire the virtues of previous philosophers. In the course of wandering in pursuit of his studies he traveled to the regions of Yan and Zhao and visited the states of Lu and Wei. After leaving the district of the Three Rivers at his back he entered the interior of the region of Qin. He proceeded from the three prefectures of Shu and arrived at the state of Wukuai. He approached all learned scholars to ask for instructions and, in the presence of distinguished people, he repeatedly avowed his intention of going abroad to acquire the Dharma. He heard the discussions of various schools and made a study of their propositions, finding that they vied with each other to emphasize their own specific theories and were critical of their rivals’ teachings. This aroused his desire to get to the root of the doctrine of Buddhism and he determined to make a thorough study of the matter.

At a time when the empire within the four seas was in good order and the distant lands in the eight directions were free from trouble, he prepared himself and began the journey, traveling staff in hand, on the morning of the first day of the eighth month in the third year of the Zhenguan reign (629 C.E.). With the Emperor’s prestige he made his way, and under the protection of deities he traveled in solitude. He went out from the strategic passes at the Iron Gate and the Rocky Gate and climbed over the perilous Ice Mountains and Snow Mountains. In the course of time he reached India, where he publicized Chinese civilization in the foreign land and propagated the great teachings in the alien country. He studied Sanskrit texts under the instruction of learned scholars and the dubious points he had in his mind were resolved by reading the books. As regards the profound doctrines, he sought the elucidation of highly talented teachers. He opened his mind to understand the ultimate truth and clarified his spirit to realize the Way. He heard what he had never heard before and acquired what had not yet been acquired. He became a beneficial friend in Buddhist circles and was indeed a master in the gate of the Dharma. From this we may know that his religious fame was prominent and his virtuous deeds were lofty and noble. His store of knowledge was accumulated over three years and his reputation spread ten thousand _li._ The scholars of India respected him for his great virtue, calling him Basket Full of Scriptures or General of the Dharma. The Hinayana disciples named him Mokṣadeva (“Deity of Emancipation”), while the Mahayana followers called him Mahāyānadeva (“Deity of the Great Vehicle”). These were titles bestowed on him in honor of his virtue, eulogistic epithets used to show respect for his personality.

As regards the abstruse theories of the three classifications of the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and the subtle sayings spoken by the Buddha after three inquiries, he conducted profound research into their roots and acquired a full understanding of the leaves and branches. He promptly became intellectually enlightened and happily clarified his theoretical entanglements. The dubious points he had raised were recorded in certain works. Having made a deep study of the theoretical principles and mastered the lore of metaphysics, with his repute as an erudite scholar spreading widely and having achieved great virtue, he began touring the country, visiting the towns and their vicinities. He left the city of Kuśāgrapura and entered the Deer Park, and after visiting Yaṣṭivana (Yaṣṭi Wood) he rested at Kukkuṭārāma Monastery. He looked around the country of Kapilavastu and had a glimpse of the city of Kuśinagara. The old site of the Buddha’s birthplace had turned into a plain of fertile land and the other sites of secret spirituality lay in ruins in vast wildernesses. When he looked for the divine traces his remembrance of the past glories increased, and he sighed with regret while recalling the Buddha’s teachings with admiration. He was not merely like Jizi, who sang the _Ode to Flowering Wheat_ in sorrow over the fallen dynasty of Yin, nor was he similar to the senior official at the court of Zhou, who composed the _Lyric of the Millet Shoots_ lamenting the collapse of the house of Zhou. He narrated in detail the stories of Sākyamuni Buddha and gave an account of many historical facts of India. He also recounted the manners and customs of various places and wrote down the strange legends. Time passed swiftly and he sojourned in India for several years. Although he was much attached to the Land of Happiness he did not forget to return to his homeland.

He procured one hundred and fifty grains of the Tathāgata’s relic bones; a golden image of the Buddha one foot six inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the shadow image in the dragon’s cave at Prāgbodhi Mountain in the country of Magadha; a golden image of the Buddha three feet three inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the image of the Buddha in the posture of turning the wheel of the Dharma for the first time at Deer Park in the country of Bārāṇasī; a sandalwood image of the Buddha one foot five inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the sandalwood portrait made by King Udayana of the country of Kauśāmbī when he longed to see the Tathāgata; a sandalwood image of the Buddha two feet nine inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the image of the Tathāgata descending by a precious stairway from the heavenly palace to earth in the country of Kapitha; a silver image of the Buddha four feet high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the image of the Buddha as he was preaching the _Saddharmapuṇdarīka-sūtra_ and other scriptures on Vulture Peak in the country of Magadha; a golden image of the Buddha three feet five inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the shadow portrait left by the Buddha when he had subdued a venomous dragon in the country of Nagarahāra; a sandalwood image of the Buddha one foot three inches high, including the base and halo, an imitation of the Buddha’s image in the posture of making a tour in the [capital] city of the country of Vaiśālī to edify the inhabitants. [He also brought back] two hundred and twenty- four Mahayana scriptures; one hundred and ninety-two Mahayana treatises; fourteen scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Sthavira school; fifteen scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Mahāsāṃghika school; fifteen scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Saṃmitīya school; twenty-two scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Mahīśāsaka school; seventeen scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Kāśyapīya school; forty-two scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Dharmagupta school; sixty-seven scriptures, disciplinary texts, and treatises of the Sarvāstivāda school; thirty-six texts on _hetuvidyā_ (logic); and thirteen texts on _śabdavidyā_ (Sanskrit grammar): altogether six hundred and fifty-seven books bound in five hundred and twenty bundles.

In order to propagate the supreme teachings he prepared his carriage for the return journey on the perilous way. He came out of the old country of Śrāvastī and left the former suburbs of Gayā. After ascending the dangerous path over the Cong Ling Mountains and traversing the hazardous passage through the desert, he arrived in the capital in the first month of the spring of the nineteenth year (of the Zhenguan reign, 645 C.E.). He had an interview with the Emperor at Luoyang, who ordered him to translate the Sanskrit texts into Chinese. He summoned scholars to work with him to achieve this superior deed through joint effort. The Cloud of the Dharma again cast [its protective] shade and the Sun of Wisdom emitted brilliant light anew. The edification that the Buddha taught at Vulture Peak prevailed in the Chinese capital, and the teachings brought out from the dragon’s palace were expounded in the metropolitan district. This was a time of prosperity in the spread of Buddhism during its image period.

The Master is dexterously conversant with the Sanskrit language, with which he praised the profound Buddhist texts. He reads Sanskrit books as if they were his own compositions and his intonation still echoes in the air. Strictly adhering to the Buddha’s meanings, he does not add any embellishments to his translations. Unknown dialects and previouly untranslated Sanskrit terms have been carefully studied and weighed through research and mutual collation with passages from classical Buddhist texts, lest deviations should occur.

A gentleman in official dress approached the Master and said earnestly to him, “India is a country where divine beings and saints assembled and people of virtue were born. Their writing is that of the gods and their language that of the deities, with graceful and well-constructed diction rhythmically pronounced, with one word having many meanings, and one meaning being expressed in different words. There are falling and rising intonations and voiced as well as unvoiced consonants. The translation of the profound Buddhist texts must depend on brilliant scholars and the abstmse essences of the scriptures must be explained by people of great virtue. If deletions are made in a translation or if the words are tuned according to musical notation it is really inappropriate and cannot truly be regarded as good work. The exposition of the profound essences of the scriptures must be easily understandable. So long as it is not contradictory to the original meaning it may be considered well done. Excessive embellishments may render a translation too flowery in style; if [the language] is too simple it will be inelegant. Only when it is done in a plain style without ornamentation and written elegantly without being dull can a work be free of grave blunders and counted as a good translation. Laozi said, ‘Florid sayings are not trustworthy and trustworthy words are not florid.’ Hanzi said, ‘When one’s reason is justifiable one’s speech is straightforward; if one talks in ornate language he is hiding the truth.’ From these maxims we may know that the principle is equally applicable to all things. It is hoped that obscure and unintelligible points may be expurgated for the readers’ benefit and delight. It is very harmful to deviate from the original meanings in order to give place to ornamental verbiage, and adherence to obsolete rules is something to which the Buddha strongly objected.” Both the monks and the laity said unanimously, “Yes! What has been said is really true!”

Formerly, when Confucius was in a position to hear litigation he used to write verdicts jointly with others and never did so by himself alone. In composing his _Spring and Autumn Annals_ he wrote what should be written and deleted what should be cut out, and even such learned literati among his disciples as Ziyou and Zixia could not aid him in writing a word. The Master did his translation in the same way. He is not like Kumārajīva, who translated Buddhist texts at the Garden of Leisure and Repose, allowing his disciples Daosheng, Sengzhao, Daorong, and Sengrai to make deletions as they pleased. How could we add or remove anything of the Buddha’s teachings in an age when the angles of a square are cut off to make it round and when ostentation is discarded and simplicity upheld?

*Note by Bianji*

I, Bianji, the descendant of a remote progenitor who believed in high culture, cherished the ambition even as a child to lead a life of seclusion. When I had just reached school age I cut my hair, changed into religious robes, and became a disciple of Venerable Daoyue of the Sarvāstivāda school in the great Zongchi Monastery. Although I met a learned teacher my stupidity rendered me as useless as a piece of rotten wood that cannot be carved into shape. I was lucky to have entered the stream of the Dharma but I failed to saturate myself in the dew of learning, and I merely ate my fill all day long and did nothing but face the wall to pass the years. Fortunately the time came for me to take part in this fine gathering of intellectuals where, even with my ability as meager as that of a sparrow, I worked at the end of a long line of brilliant scholars, resembling lofty swans, in writing this _Record_ with my smattering of literary knowledge. I am not a student who is well versed in ancient writings and my compositions are devoid of ornamental phrases. I worked just like one who carves a piece of rotten wood with a blunt burin, toiling as laboriously as a lame person. I respectfully listened to the words, committed them to writing, and put them in proper order. Under the orders of the Secretary of State I compiled the _Record_ as it is presented here. Due to my shallow wisdom and limited ability, I must have made many unintentional omissions and there may be surplus words that should have been deleted. Formerly, when the highly talented historian Sima Zichang wrote his _Historical Records,_ succeeding to his father’s task as grand historian, even he sometimes only mentioned the given name of a person and neglected the second name. As regards places, he often only denoted the name of the county without indicating that of the prefecture. So it is said that even a discreet scholar when working alone on a heavy and complicated task is apt to be neglectful, let alone a person of slow wits and poor capability, such as myself. How could I expect to be perfect and consummate in my work?

The different topographical conditions and social customs, the territorial limits and native products, the temperament and intelligence of different peoples, as well as the cold and warm climates of the four seasons in various regions have been ascertained and described in detail, good or bad, according to the actual facts. As regards the personal names of people of different tribes, they are given together with the names of their countries of origin. Indian customs and teachings are divided into two categories, namely, religious and secular. All these are briefly narrated but a full description can be found in the preceding preface. Such matters as social etiquette, ceremonies, household registration, brave warriors, and religious recluses are not described in detail.

The Buddha contacted people through the employment of supernatural powers and taught them with spiritual admonition, and it is said that his divine Way is deep and mysterious, its principles alien to the human world, and that whatever profundities he exposed in his spiritual admonitions are concerned with things beyond the sky. Brief accounts, with succinct notes, have been given for all the places where the Buddha left his auspicious traces, and for the ruins connected with the good names of former sages. The roads wound and zigzagged and the boundaries of different countries unevenly interlocked with one another. Descriptions of the places of the Master’s journey have been presented in sequence, without editorial arrangement. The different parts of India, irrespective of national boundaries, are indicated at the end of the description of each country, in order to give a rough idea of its whereabouts. Where the word “going” is used in the narration, it means that the Master visited the place in person; the word “reaching” signifies that he merely gathered information [about a place] for his record. It is variously written in a straightforward way, according to facts, or in a mild and roundabout way to put it in a graceful style with well-balanced words, in order to submit a trustworthy record to His Supreme Majesty the Emperor.

In the seventh month in the autumn of the twentieth year (of the Zhenguan reign, 646 C.E.) I completed the compilation, inscribed it on pure white silk, and presented it to the Emperor for his perusal, despite my uncertainty whether it would meet His Majesty’s expectations. However, the risky journey to a distant land was actually undertaken under the prestige of the imperial court and the composition of the topographical record of foreign countries was done with curiosity under His Majesty’s inspiration. It was not only Kuafu who had the strength to chase the sun to the remotest realms; the opening up of the Western Regions can by no means be solely due to the merit of the Marquis of Bowang. Vulture Peak is made known in China through this _Record,_ and Deer Park is rendered as familiar as the outer garden of the imperial palace. It enables one to visualize what happened a thousand years ago and see the sights along the ten thousand-_li_ journey as if one had visited the places in person. All of this has not been heard of since the remote past, nor was it recorded in previous books.

The Emperor’s supreme virtue covers all, and different countries with diverse customs have come to offer allegiance. The tradition of honesty and magnanimity has spread to far regions, even wild and out-of-the-way locales, without exception. This _Record_ may serve as a supplement to the _Shanhai jing;_ let it be published as a chronicle and distributed to the concerned authorities as a general reference.

*The Country of Magadha (Part 2)*

To the east of the _bodhi_ tree and across the Nairañjanā River there is a stupa in a great wood, and to the north of the stupa is a pond where a fragrant elephant attended his mother. In the past, when the Tathāgata was practicing the deeds of a bodhisattva, he was born as the son of a fragrant elephant, living on North Mountain, and he came to the pond for pleasure. As his mother was blind, he drew pure water and fetched lotus roots to feed her with respect and filial piety; this he did for a long time. A man once lost his way while traveling through the wood, and walked back and forth, weeping piteously. Hearing the sound, the young elephant felt pity for the man, guided him out of the wood, and showed him the way home. After the man returned home he reported to the king, “I know that a fragrant elephant is wandering about the pond in the wood. This is a rare animal and you can go capture it.”

The king agreed and sent soldiers to capture the elephant. The man accompanied them as a guide but at the very moment he pointed out the young elephant for the king, both his arms fell off as if they had been severed. Even though the king was surprised by the sight he still captured the young elephant and brought him home. The young elephant refused to eat grass or drink water for a long time after he was caught. The stable keeper informed the king, who went personally to inquire into the matter. The young elephant said, “My mother is blind and is starving all day long. As I am now a captive, how can I enjoy delicious food?” Moved by the elephant’s filial sentiment, the king released him. In front of the stupa beside the pond is a stone pillar where Kāśyapa Buddha sat in meditation in the past. Beside it are places where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down.

After crossing the Mahā River to the east of the seats of the four past buddhas, I reached a great wood in which there is a stone pillar marking the place where a heretic sat in meditation and made an evil vow. In the past the heretic Udraka Rāmaputra was someone who aspired to spiritual attainment and made his abode in the wilderness. He engaged his mind in meditation and lived in seclusion in this wood of religious practice. As he had gained the five supernormal powers and achieved the _samādhi_ of neither thought nor non-thought, the king of Magadha highly respected him and invited the hermit to the palace for a meal every day at noon. Udraka Rāmaputra traveled through the air to and fro without interruption and the king of Magadha would look into the air and wait for him. On his arrival the king received him and gave him a seat.

Once the king was about to go out on a pleasure trip and intended to entrust 919b someone to serve the hermit. But there was no one in the inner palace who was competent to answer the call, except his own daughter, a courteous, well behaved, and prudent young lady with a kind heart whom no one excelled in amiability and virtue. The king of Magadha summoned his daughter and ordered her, ‘I am traveling to a distant place and have something to entrust to you. Please be careful to fulfill this duty to completion. The hermit Udraka Rāmaputra is someone I always venerate respectfully. When he comes at mealtimes you should serve him as I do.” Having given this instruction the king started on his journey. Under the king’ order the young maid waited for the hermit as usual, and upon his arrival she received him and took him to his seat. Due to having been in contact with a woman, Udraka Rāmaputra felt an impulse of desire and lost his supernormal powers.

After the meal was over and he was about to return the hermit found that he was no longer able to fly. Ashamed, he said deceitfully to the maid, “I have been practicing the Way and sitting in meditation with a peaceful mind for many years, and I am used to flying through the air without any leisure moments. I heard long ago that the people of the country wished to see me. Previous teachers taught us that we should work for the benefit of others as our duty. How can one work only for one’s own good and forget about altruistic considerations? I now wish to depart through the door and walk on the earth so that those who see me may gain bliss and benefit.” On hearing these words, the princess made a public announcement. Thereupon, the people hurriedly sprinkled water and swept the thoroughfare clean, and hundreds and thousands of people stood still for a long time, waiting for the appearance of the hermit.

Udraka Rāmaputra walked from the palace to the religious wood and sat down to practice meditation, but his mind was disturbed by the external environment. When he stayed in the wood he heard the crowing and chirping of crows and other birds, and when he was near the pond the splashing of fish and turtles annoyed him. His attention was distracted and his mind confused, and he lost his spirit and was unable to practice meditation. He became enraged and made an evil vow, saying, ‘‘Let me be in the future a fierce and wicked animal with the body of a leopard and the wings of a bird, preying on living creatures. My body will be three thousand _li_ in width and each of the wings fifteen hundred _li_ in length. I shall haunt the forests to devour the feathered tribes (birds) and enter the waters to eat aquatic animals.” After he made this vow his anger gradually abated, and through hard work he regained his original meditative state soon afterward. Before long he died and was reborn in the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Non-thought, enjoying a life span of eighty thousand _kalpas._ The Tathāgata predicted that after the conclusion of his heavenly life the hermit would realize his original vow and be reborn as the ugly creature. From that time on he would cycle in the evil states of transmigration without a fixed time for his release.

To the east of the Mahā River I entered a great jungle and, going for more than one hundred _li,_ I reached Kukkuṭapāda (known as Jizu, “Cock’s Foot,” in Chinese) Mountain, also called Gurupāda (known as Zunzu, “Sage’s Foot,” in Chinese) Mountain. The lofty peaks are extremely steep and the deep valleys seem to be bottomless. At the foot of the mountain and among the brooks there are tall trees in the valleys, and the peaks and cliffs are covered in luxuriant green grass. There are three precipitous, cloud-capped peaks, nearly touching the sky. Because Venerable Mahākāśyapa entered nirvana on this mountain people of later times, not wishing to mention his name inappropriately, called it Guru’s Foot Mountain.

Mahākāśyapa was a _śrāvaka_ disciple [of the Buddha] who achieved the six supernatural powers and possessed the eight forms of liberation. When the Tathāgata had completed his career of edification and was about to enter nirvana, he told Kāśyapa, “For innumerable _kalpas_ I diligently practiced austerities seeking the supreme Dharma for the benefit of all living beings. As I have now fulfilled my desire and expectation that I wished for in the past, I am going to enter _mahānirvāṇa._ I entrust to you the Dharma _piṭaka_ and you should preserve and spread it and never let it degrade. I will leave behind the golden-thread _kaṣāya_ that my aunt offered to me, to be transmitted to Maitreya when he becomes a buddha in the future. All those who cultivate themselves in my bequeathed teaching, whether _bhikṣus, bhikṣunīs, upāsakas,_ or _upāsikā_s (male and female lay devotees), should first be delivered from the cycle of transmigration.”

Having received the Buddha’s instructions, Kāśyapa upheld the right Dharma. In the twentieth year after the conclusion of the Great Council he grew tired of the impermanent world and wished to enter nirvana. He went to Kukkuṭa Mountain and climbed the north side of the mountain; going by a roundabout route he reached the southwest ridge. The peaks are dangerous and difficult to ascend, and the paths are tortuous and overgrown with weeds. He cleared the way with his pewter staff and cut down the weeds as if he were using a knife. After he had opened the mountain path he proceeded along the roundabout route in a crisscross manner. On reaching the summit he faced the northeast. Standing amid the three peaks, he held the Buddha’s _kaśāya_ [robe] in both hands and, by the power of his vow, the three peaks closed together, leaving behind the three protuberant ridges we see now.

When Maitreya comes to the world as a World-honored One he will preach the Dharma in three assemblies. After that there will still be numerous arrogant people who will ascend this mountain and come to the place of Kāśyapa. Maitreya will snap his fingers, and the mountain peaks will open by themselves, and, seeing Kāśyapa, the people will become all the more arrogant. At this moment Mahākāśyapa will hand over the _kaṣāya_ [to Maitreya]. After making a speech and paying homage [to the new buddha] Kāśyapa will rise into the air and manifest various divine transformations. A fire will burst forth to cremate his body and in this manner he will enter nirvana. Having seen this sight, the people will abandon their pride and then will be awakened and realize sainthood. Therefore a stupa has been built on the mountain. On quiet nights a burning torch can be seen from a distance, but if one goes up the mountain nothing can be seen.

Going more than one hundred _li_ northeast from Kukkuṭapāda Mountain I reached Buddhavana Mountain with its lofty peaks and steep cliffs. Among the rocks is a cave where the Buddha once stayed. Beside the cave is a huge rock on which Indra and Brahma pulverized oxhead sandalwood and rubbed the body of the Tathāgata with the powder. Even now the rock retains a strong fragrance. The latent spirits of the five hundred arhats remain here. Those who have the chance to meet them may see them appearing as _śrāmaṇeras_ going to the villages to collect alms. Their miraculous deeds, whether secret or manifest, are difficult to relate in detail.

Going east for more than thirty _li_ in the deep valleys of Buddhavana Mountain, I reached Yaṣṭi Wood (known as “Stick Wood” in Chinese), full of bamboo that covers the mountain and valleys. Formerly there was a brahman who heard that Sākya Buddha was sixteen feet tall, but he doubted this and did not believe it. So he used a sixteen-foot-long long bamboo stick to measure the height of the Buddha but each time he did so, the Buddha’s height always exceeded the length of the stick by sixteen feet. In this manner the brahman found the Buddha’s height becoming higher and higher and he could not ascertain his actual height. He cast off the stick and went away; the stick took root, [giving rise to the bamboo grove]. In the wood there is a great stupa built by King Aśoka. Formerly the Tathāgata showed great supernatural powers and preached the deep and subtle Dharma for various heavenly and human beings at this place for seven days.

In Yaṣṭi Wood there was recently an _upāsaka_ named Jayasena (known as Shengjun, “Victorious Army,” in Chinese), a man of the _kṣatriya_ caste of West India. He preferred to live a plain and simple life in the mountains and forests, and while he stayed in the world of illusion his mind dwelled in the state of reality. He was learned in the subtle meanings of both Buddhist and heretical texts, eloquent in discussion and perspicuous in thinking. Various _śramaṇas,_ brahmans, heretical and heterodox scholars, kings, ministers, elders, and wealthy and powerful people approached him to seek his instructions with full conviction. His disciples could be found in six families out of ten. When he was nearly seventy years old he still devoted himself to arduous study without fatigue. He gave up all other subjects of learning and engaged himself solely in the study of Buddhist scriptures, exerting himself mentally and physically day and night.

In India it is the custom to make miniature stupas, five or six inches high, out of scented clay. Copies of scriptures are put inside these stupas, which are known as Dharma relics. When a large number of such stupas has been accumulated a great stupa is constructed to contain them all for perpetual veneration. Whenever Jayasena was teaching his disciples, as he orally inculcated them with the wonderful Dharma his hands were busy making small stupas in order to accumulate supreme bliss. At night he walked to and fro, or worshiped and recited scriptures, or sat in quiet meditation, taking no time to sleep or eat, and he never relaxed in the daytime or at night. Even when he was a hundred years old he did not lessen his effort, and over a period of thirty years he made seven _koṭis_ of Dharma relic stupas. Each time he completed one _koṭi_ of stupas he constructed a great stupa to contain all the small ones for people to make offerings to, and monks were invited to celebrate religious functions. On each occasion a divine light shone brightly, an apparent spiritual manifestation, and after that a light was emitted from time to time.

More than ten _li_ to the southwest of Yaṣṭi Wood there are two hot springs to the south of a great mountain. The water is very hot and after the Buddha had caused these springs he bathed in them. They are still in existence and the flow of clear water has never diminished. People come here from far and near to bathe and the springs may effect a cure for those who suffer from chronic illness. Beside the springs is a stupa built at a place where the Tathā- gata walked up and down. Going southeast for six or seven _li_ from Yaṣṭi Wood, I reached a great mountain. In front of a ridge of the mountain there is a stone stupa. In the past the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this place for the three months of the rains retreat. At that time King Bimbisāra wished to come to listen to the Dharma, so a passageway through the mountain, with stone steps more than twenty paces wide and three or four _li_ in length, was built to the site.

Three or four _li_ to the north of the great mountain is an isolated hill where the hermit Vyāsa once dwelled. The cave he excavated in the rock is still in existence. He imparted his teachings to his disciples and the system of his learning is still prevalent. Four or five _li_ to the northeast of this isolated hill is a smaller isolated hill. The size of the cave excavated in the rock of the hill is large enough to provide seats for over one thousand people. In the past the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this place for three months. Above the cave is a big rock on which Indra and Brahma ground oxhead sandalwood to rub the powder on the Buddha’s body. The fragrance lingering on the rock is still very strong.

At the southwest corner of the cave there is a grotto known in India as Asura’s Palace. A mischievous man, skillful in the art of sorcery, once invited [thirteen] close friends who shared the same interests, and the group of fourteen went together into the grotto. After going for thirty or forty _li_ they came out into an open, bright place and saw city walls, terraces, and pavilions all made of gold, silver, and lapis lazuli. When they approached the city some young maidens standing by the city gate pleasntly and cordially welcomed them. Then they proceeded and eventually arrived at the inner city, where two maidservants, standing by the gate, each holding a golden tray full of flowers and incense, greeted them and said, “You must bathe yourselves in the pool, rub your bodies with incense, and put on garlands before you can be admitted in the proper manner. The sorcerer may go in right away, however.” The thirteen friends went to bathe but as soon as they entered the bathing pool they forgot everything and found themselves sitting in a paddy field on a plain thirty or forty _li_ to the north of the grotto.

Beside the grotto there is a viaduct more than ten paces wide and four or five _li_ in length. In the past, when King Bimbisāra was about to go to the place of the Buddha, rocks were cleared from the valley, precipices were leveled to dredge the stream, and stones were piled up and cliffs excavated to make steps leading to the place of the Buddha.

From this great mountain going east for more than sixty _li,_ I reached the city of Kuśāgrapura (known as Shangmaogongcheng, “Superior Reed Palace City,” in Chinese). Kuśāgrapura, in the center of the country of Magadha, was the capital of previous kings in ancient times. It is so called because it abounds in superior and lucky fragrant reeds. The surrounding hills serve as its outer walls, with a narrow path leading to the west and a passage opening to the north. It is long from east to west, narrow from south to north, and more than one hundred fifty _li_ in circuit. _Karṇikāra_ (mayeng) trees grow everywhere on the mountain paths. The flowers have a special fragrance and are golden in color. Late in spring the whole wood becomes golden-colored.

Outside the north gate of the palace city is a stupa built at the place where Devadatta, who was on intimate terms with Ajātaśatru, loosed the intoxicated elephant Dhanapāla in an attempt to hurt the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata produced five lions from the tips of [his] five fingers to tame the drunken elephant before going on his way.

To the northeast of the place where the drunken elephant was subdued was the spot where Śāriputra attained sainthood on hearing the Dharma preached by Aśvajit (known as Masheng, “Victorious Horse,” in Chinese) Bhikṣu. When Śāriputra was a layman he was well known for his high talents and broadmindedness, and he had disciples and pupils studying under his instruction. He was once going to the great city of Rājagṛha when Aśvajit Bhikṣu was on almsround. Seeing Aśvajit from a distance, Śāriputra said to his disciples, “That man over there looks very graceful and refined in deportment. He could not be so calm and quiet in demeanor unless he has attained sainthood Let us wait here a moment and see where he is going.” Being an arhat, Aśvajit Bhikṣu was free from mental defilements and carried himself in a gentle and peaceful manner, holding a religious staff in hand. Śāriputra said to him, “Elder Sir, are you living in good health and happiness? Who is your teacher and what Dharma have you realized that you look so happy and contented?” Aśvajit said, “Do you not know that the prince of King Śuddhodana relinquished his position as a wheel-turning monarch and, out of pity for all beings in the six paths of transmigration, he practiced austerities for six years and attained perfect enlightenment and now possesses all-knowing wisdom? He is my teacher. As regards the Dharma, it is neither real nor empty and it is difficult to give a systematic exposition of it. It can be fully explained only by the buddhas. How could I, an ignorant person, discuss the matter in detail?” Aśvajit then uttered a stanza in praise of the buddha-dharma and Śāriputra attained sainthood on hearing the stanza.

Not far to the north of the place where Śāriputra attained sainthood there is a large, deep pit beside which a stupa has been built. This was the place where Śrīgupta (known as Shengmi, “Auspicious Secrecy,” in Chinese) attempted to kill the Buddha in a fire pit and with poisoned rice. Śrīgupta had faith in the heretics and held fast to erroneous views. Some brahmans said to him, “Gautama is respected by the people of the country so we have lost our supporters. Invite him to a meal at your home. At the gate of your house dig a big pit, light a fire in it, then cover the pit with some rotten timber and camouflage it with dry earth. Poison should be put into all food and drink you serve him. Even if he escapes the fire pit he will be poisoned to death.” Following this suggestion, Śrīgupta prepared a meal and poisoned the food. All the people in the city knew that Śrīgupta plotted against the World-honored One with an evil intention, and they all exhorted the Buddha not to go [to his house] for the meal. The World-honored One told them, “Do not worry! Nothing can harm the body of a tathāgata.” He accepted the invitation and went, and as soon as his foot touched the doorsill the fire pit turned into a pool full of lotus flowers growing out of clear, lucid water. Śrīgupta was panic-stricken at this but said to his disciples, “Even if the Buddha has escaped the fire pit through magical power there is still poisoned food for him.” After the World-honored One had taken the meal he preached the wonderful Dharma and, on hearing the Dharma, Śrīgupta apologized for his misdeeds and took refuge in the Buddha.

At a bend of the mountain city to the northeast of Śrīgupta’s fire pit is a stupa where the great physician Jīvaka (wrongly transliterated as Qipo in Chinese) built a preaching hall for the Buddha. Flowers and fruit trees were planted at the open spaces around the building, and remains of the structure and new sprouts from the old plants can still be seen. When the Tathāgata was living in the world he stayed mostly in this hall. Beside it is the site of Jīvaka’s private residence; the remnant foundations and an old well still exist in ruins.

Going northeast for fourteen or fifteen _li_ from the palace city, I reached Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain (known in China as “Vulture Peak” or “[Vulture] Terrace,” formerly mistranscribed as Qishejue Mountain). It links with the south side of North Mountain, protruding all alone to a great height, where vultures perch; it also resembles a high terrace. The verdant mountain presents a distinct color in contrast with the sky. During the fifty years of his missionary career the Tathāgata stayed on this mountain on many occasions to preach the wonderful Dharma.

In order to hear the Buddha’s preaching, King Bimbisāra sent men to build a road leading from the foot of the mountain to the summit, more than ten paces wide and five or six _li_ in length, across valleys and over rocks, with stones piled up into steps. There are two small stupas on the way. One is known as the place of alighting, where the king [dismounted from his carriage] to walk on foot, proceeding on his way; the other stupa is the place of where ordinary people were barred from going farther [with the king]. The summit is oblong from east to west and narrow from south to north. On the brink of the west side of the precipice is a brick shrine, high and spacious, built in a marvelous style, with its door opening to the east. The Tathāgata preached the Dharma at this place many times. There is now a life-size statue of the Tathāgata in the posture of delivering a sermon.

To the east of the shrine is an oblong stone on which the Tathāgata walked to and fro. Beside it is a great rock, fourteen or fifteen feet high and more than thirty paces in circumference. This was the place where Devadatta hurled a stone from a distance to strike the Buddha. To the south and below the cliff was the place where the Tathāgata preached the _Saddharmapuṇdarīka-sītra_ in olden times. To the south of the shrine and beside a steep rock is a cave where the Tathāgata sat in meditation in days of yore. To the northwest of the Buddha’s cave there is another cave, in front of which is a huge rock where Ānanda was frightened by Māra. Once when Venerable Ānanda was sitting in meditation at this place, Māra transformed himself into a vulture and occupied the huge rock one night in the black half of the month, flapping his wings violently and shrieking terrifically to frighten Ānanda. The venerable monk was alarmed and terror-stricken. The Tathāgata, seeing him in trouble, stretched out a comforting hand through the stone wall of the cave, stroked Ānanda’s head, and said to him with great compassion, “It is merely a phantom of Māra. Do not be frightened!” Reassured, Ānanda felt at ease and happy both physically and mentally. The traces left by the bird on the rock and the hole made in the stone wall in the cave still exist despite the long passage of time. Beside the shrine there are several caves in which Śāriputra and other great arhats practiced meditation. In front of Śāriputra’s cave is a big well; it is now dried up but the mouth of the well still exists in the ruins.

A huge flat rock in the stony gully to the northeast of the shrine is the place where the Tathāgata dried his _kaṣāya._ The stripes of the robe left on the rock are as distinct as if they were carved on it. Beside the rock are the footprints of the Buddha. Although the traces are obscure their size and shape are still discernible. On top of North Mountain is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata gazed at the city of Magadha and preached the Dharma for seven days.

To the west of the north gate of the mountain city is Vipula Hill. I heard the local people say that on the north side of the cliff, southwest of the hill, there used to be five hundred hot springs but now there are only a few score, Not all of them are hot springs, as some are cold and others are warm. The source of these springs is Anavatapta Lake to the south of the Snow Mountains; the water flows underground to this place. It is nice and clear and tastes the same as the water in its lake of origin. The water flows out in five hundred streams through the small hot hells, and as the fire of the hells rises up it makes the water of the springs lukewarm. All the mouths of the springs have stone carvings in the shapes of the heads of lions or white elephants; aqueducts lead the water below into tanks made of slabs of stone. People come from various places in different regions to bathe in the tanks and they can often wash away their old maladies. On both the right and the left sides of the hot springs stupas and shrines were built with their foundations laid as closely together as the scales of a fish, and all of these are sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down in ancient times. This place of mountains and streams is an ideal hermitage for wise and benevolent people to take up their abodes and there must be many recluses living in seclusion in this locality.

To the west of the hot springs is Pippala Cave, in which the World-honored One always made his abode. The cavern behind the back wall of the cave is Asura’s Palace. _Bhikṣus_ who practiced meditation mostly resided in this cave. Strange phantoms in the shapes of dragons, snakes, and lions often appeared in this cave and those who saw them were driven insane. But because this is a well-known place where holy and spiritual people stayed, others, in admiration of their edification, braved the danger and came here one after another. Recently a _bhikṣu_ who was pure in observing the disciplinary rules and took delight in lodging at quiet and peaceful places desired to live in this cave to practice meditation. Someone advised him, “Do not go to that cave—it is full of disasters and many people have been killed. It will be difficult for you to gain mental concentration there and you might even lose your life. Heed the warnings from previous accidents and not cause yourself regret in the future.” The _bhikṣu_ said, “No, it is not so. I am aiming my efforts at attaining buddhahood in order to subjugate the heavenly Mara. What mischief could be worth mentioning?” He shook his pewter staff and went to the cave, where he prepared an altar and recited mantras. After ten days a young woman came out of the cavern and said to the _bhikṣu,_ “Venerable Sir, you wear the dyed robe [of a monk] and keep the disciplinary rules so that living beings may take refuge under you, and you cultivate wisdom and practice meditation to be a good guide for living creatures. But now you are staying here and we are frightened. Is this what the Tathāgata has taught you to do?” The _bhikṣu_ said, “I observe the pure rules in accordance with the Buddha’s holy teachings and live in seclusion in the mountains in order to avoid the hubbub and excitement of social life. What is wrong with my being here that causes you to accuse me?” The woman said, “When you utter mantras the sound of your voice causes a fire burn from the outside into my dwelling and causes trouble for my kinsfolk. Will you have pity on us and not repeat mantras any more?” The _bhikṣu_ said, “I recite mantras for self-protection, not to do harm to others. In the past when monks stayed here to practice meditation in the hope of gaining sainthood, so as to save those who were suffering in the dark path of transmigration, they were scared to death by the sight of your terriffying appearance. It was all your fault. What do you say to this?” The woman said in reply, “Heavy is my sin and shallow my wisdom. From now on I will live in seclusion and keep myself within bounds. But I also hope that you, Venerable Sir, will not repeat mantras.” So the _bhikṣu_ practiced meditation in peace and was not harmed.

On Vipula Mountain is a stupa where the Tathāgata formerly preached the Dharma. Now many naked heretics stay at this place, practicing austerities without negligence day and night, and from dawn to dusk they turn round to watch [the sun’s] movement.

Going east for two or three _li_ from the north side of the south cliff, on the left side of the north gate of the mountain city, I came to a great cave in which Devadatta sat in meditation in olden times. On a fiat rock not far to the east of this cave there are traces resembling bloodstains. Beside it is a stupa built at the spot where a _bhikṣu_ who practiced meditation committed suicide and attained sainthood. This _bhikṣu_ exerted mental and physical effort in practicing meditation in seclusion but he failed to attain sainthood after long time had passed. He blamed himself and said regretfully, “I could not attain the perfect stage of sainthood with nothing more to learn in a timely way. What is the use of keeping this body of mine, which is really a burden to me?” So he came to this rock and cut his throat. At that very moment he realized arhatship, ascended into the air, performed miraculous transformations, produced a fire to cremate his body, and entered nirvana. This stupa was built in memory of his merits and to extol his sublime character.

On the cliff to the east of the place where the _bhikṣu_ [committed suicide and] attained sainthood is a stone stupa at the spot where another _bhikṣu_ practiced meditation, threw himself down the cliff, and gained sainthood. At the time of the Buddha there was once a _bhikṣu_ who sat in the woods and mountains, practicing meditation in order to achieve sainthood. He worked hard for a long time but could not realize his wish. Day and night he never forgot to fix his mind in tranquil meditation. Knowing that the fundamental ability of the _bhikṣu_ was about to be fully developed, the Tathāgata went to render assistance to him. He came from the Bamboo Grove to the foot of the cliff, snapped his fingers to call the _bhikṣu,_ and stood there waiting for him. Seeing the holy monks from a distance, the _bhikṣu_ was encouraged and jumped down the cliff with delight. As his mind was pure and he had faith in the Buddha’s words, he gained sainthood before his body reached the ground. The World-honored One told him, “You should know it isn ow the time!” The _bhikṣu_ then ascended into the air and showed divine manifestations. In order to exalt the _bhikṣu_'s pure faith this stupa was built as a memorial.

Going out of the north gate of the mountain city for about one _li,_ I reached Kalandaka Bamboo Garden, in which there is now a temple, a brick chamber built on stone bases with a door opening to the east. When the Tathāgata was living in the world he spent much time in this temple, preaching the Dharma for the edification and guidance of the common people and converting the secular folk. There is a life-size image of the Tathāgata of recent origin. At the beginning there was an eminent elder named Kalandaka, well known for his nobility and enormous wealth. He presented this great Bamboo Garden to the heretics but after he saw the Tathāgata and heard the Dharma with pure faith, he regretted that he had given his garden as a lodging for the heterodox believers and now did not have a place to house the Teacher of Human and Heavenly Beings. At that time various gods and spirits, moved by the elder’s sincerity, expelled the heretics and told them, “Elder Kalandaka wishes to build a temple for the Buddha in Bamboo Garden. You should quickly go away so as to avoid mishap and disaster.” The heretics left the garden in anger and resentment. The elder built a temple in the garden and when the construction was completed he went in person to invite the Buddha, who then accepted the gift.

To the east of Kalandaka Bamboo Garden is a stupa built by King Ajāta- śatru (known in Chinese as Weishengyuan, “Enemy Before Birth,” formerly abridged wrongly as Asheshi). After the Tathāgata’s nirvana the various kings shared his relic bones and King Ajātaśatru obtained his portion, for which he built this stupa with veneration to make offerings to the relics. Later, after King Aśoka had faith in the buddha-dharma, he opened this stupa and took out the relics for building more stupas. There are still some remnant relics in the stupa, which often emits a bright light.

In another stupa beside the one built by Ajātaśatru are entombed the relics of Venerable Ānanda’s half-body. When Venerable Ānanda was about to enter nirvana he left the country of Magadha and proceeded to the city of Vaiśālī. The two countries contended with each other [to keep Ānanda’s body] and were on the brink of war. Out of pity for them, Ānanda divided his body. When the king of Magadha got his portion he brought it back and built a stupa for it at this superior place. Beside it is the spot where the Tathā- gata formerly walked up and down. Not far from here is a stupa built at the place where Sāriputra and Maudgalaputra stayed to observe the summer retreat during the rainy season.

Five or six _li_ to the southwest from the Bamboo Garden and to the north of South Mountain, there is a large cave in a great bamboo grove. Mahā- kāśyapa and nine hundred and ninety-nine great arhats stayed here to collect the Tripiṭaka after the nirvana of the Tathāgata. In front of the cave are the old foundations of a hall built by King Ajātaśatru for the great arhats who took part in collecting the Dharma _piṭaka._ In the beginning, Mahākāśyapa was sitting at leisure in a mountain forest when he suddenly saw a brilliant light and the earth quaked. He said, “What does this strange phenomenon augur?” He observed with his divine eye and saw that the Buddha, the World-honored One, had entered nirvana at the twin [_śala_] trees. He ordered his disciples to go with him to the city of Kuśinagara and on the road they met a brahman holding some celestial flowers in his hand. Kāśyapa asked him, “Where do you come from? Do you know where my great teacher is?” The brahman said, “I have just come from the city of Kuśinagara and I have seen that your great teacher has entered nirvana. Human and heavenly beings in a great assembly are making offerings to him. These flowers in my hand were obtained from them.”

Hearing these words, Kāśyapa said to his disciples, “The Sun of Wisdom has sunk and the world is enveloped in darkness. The Good Guide has abandoned us and living beings will stumble and fall.” The indolent _bhikṣus,_ however, felt happy and said to each other gleefully, “Since the Tathāgata has entered nirvana we will be able to live an easy life. No one will reproach or restrain us if we commit any fault.” Having heard these words, Kāśyapa felt all the more sorrowful and thought about collecting the Dharma _piṭaka_ as a guiding principle to prevent the violation of moral regulations taught by the Buddha. He then went to the twin [_śala_] trees to see and worship the Buddha.

After the demise of the King of the Dharma human and heavenly beings lost their guide, and various great arhats also entered nirvana. At that time Mahākāśyapa considered that the Dharma_piṭaka_ should be collected in obedience to the Buddha’s teachings. So he ascended Mount Sumeru, shuck a big bell, and made an announcement, saying, “A Dharma event is to be conducted in the city of Rājagṛha. All those who have attained sainthood should promptly assemble!” Kāśyapa’s summons was carried by the sound of the bell to all the three-thousand great chiliocosms,and, on hearing the summons, all those who had acquired supernatural powers came to the assembly. At that time Kāśyapa told the congregation, “The Tathāgata has entered nirvana and the world is now empty. We should collect the Dharma _piṭaka_ in order to repay the Buddha’s kindness. Only a select number of people may take part in collecting the Dharma, so that they may work in peace. We should not flock into a crowd and upset this sublime task. Only superior people who possess the three kinds of knowledge and the six supernatural powers, who have heard and practiced what is not erroneous, and who are eloquent without hindrance are invited to take part in the collection, while those who have more to learn should return to their respective abodes.” A total of nine hundred and ninety-nine persons was selected. Ānanda was not included in the list, as he was still in the stage of learning. Mahākāśyapa called to him and said, “Because you have not become spiritually perfect it is fitting for you to leave the holy assembly.” [Ānanda] said, “I attended the Tathāgata for many consecutive years. Whenever there was a discussion on the Dharma I never missed it. Now I am not allowed to take part in the task of collecting the Dharma. The King of the Dharma has entered nirvana and I have lost what I relied on.” Kāśyapa told him, “Do not be vexed! It is true that you have been the Buddha’s personal attendant and heard most of his utterances, but you are not free from the delusion of passion and your bonds of habitual illusion have not yet been cut off.” Ānanda was tongue-tied and departed. He went to a solitary place, desiring to gain the perfect stage of having nothing more to leant. Although he worked hard he could not realize his ambition. Feeling tired, he went to take a nap and at the moment just before his head touched the pillow he instantly attained arhatship. He returned to the assembly hall and knocked at the door to announce his arrival. Kāśyapa inquired, “Have you cleared off all your bonds? You should be able to utilize your supernatural powers and come in without opening the door.” Accordingly, Ānanda entered through the keyhole. After paying homage to the monks he withdrew and resumed his seat. This event occurred on the first full-moon day of the summer retreat.

Then Kāśyapa made a declaration, “Please listen to me attentively: Ānanda was praised by the Tathāgata for his all-around knowledge—let him collect the Sutra _piṭaka._ Upāli is well known to all for his clear understanding of the monastic rules—let him collect the Vinaya _piṭaka._ And I, Kāśyapa, shall collect the Abhidharma _piṭaka_.” When the three months of the rainy season came to an end the collection of the Tripiṭaka was completed. Because Mahākāśyapa was the elder among the monks and presided over the assembly, it became known as the Assembly of the Elder.

To the northwest of the place where Mahākāśyapa collected the Tripiṭaka is the spot where Ānanda came and sat in meditation and attained arhatship after he had been criticized by the monks and not allowed to take part in the gathering. He was permitted to join in the work after realizing sainthood.

More than twenty _li_ to the northwest of the spot where Ānanda attained sainthood is a stupa constructed by King Aśoka at the place where the great assembly of monks made their collection of the Buddha’s teachings. Hundreds and thousands of arhats and ordinary monks, who were not admitted to the assembly headed by Mahākāśyapa, gathered here. They said among themselves, “When the Tathāgata was living in the world we all studied under one teacher. Now that the King of the Dharma has entered nirvana we have been discriminated against. In order to repay the Buddha’s kindness we should collect the Dharma _piṭaka._ ” So the ordinary and saintly monks gathered together and sages and wise people joined the meeting. They collected the Sutra _piṭaka,_ the Vinaya _piṭaka,_ the Abhidharma _piṭaka,_ the Miscellaneous _piṭaka,_ and the Dhāraṇī _piṭaka_ as a separate fivefold _piṭaka._ Because this collection was done by both ordinary and saintly monks in the assembly, it is called the _Collection of the Great Congregation._

Going north for more than two hundred paces from Bamboo Temple I reached Kalandaka Pool. Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma at this place. The water was clear and clean and possessed the eight virtues. After the Buddha’s nirvana the pool dried up completely. Two or three _li_ to the northwest of Kalandaka Pool is a stupa built by King Aśoka, more than sixty feet high. Beside it is a stone pillar carved with an inscription narrating the events of stupa’s construction, which is more than fifty feet tall and has the figure of an elephant on top.

Not far to the northeast of the stone pillar is the city of Rājagṛha (known in Chinese as Wangshe, “Royal House”). The outer walls have been destroyed and there is no trace of them left; the inner walls, though ruined, still have foundations of some height. It is more than twenty _li_ in circuit with a gate on each side.

After King Bimbisāra made the city of Kuśāgrapura his capital the registered inhabitants frequently suffered the calamity of fire. If one family was careless the neighbors on all four sides would also be involved in the disaster. The people were busily engaged in preventing fires and had no leisure to manage their properties. So they harbored a grudge about the situation and lived uneasily in their abodes. The king said, “It is due to my lack of virtue that my subjects suffer adversities. What meritorious deeds should I do to avert their misfortune?” His ministers said, “O Great King! You rule over the country with mild virtue and magnanimity, and your governance and education are brilliant and discerning. Because the fires are caused by the imprudence of the humble people, a strict law should be proclaimed to prevent future accidents. Whenever a fire occurs the one who has caused the accident should be thoroughly investigated and the chief offender should be punished by exile to a _śītavana,_ a place in which corpses are disposed. Such places are regarded by the people as inauspicious so no one would wilingly visit them. After someone has been banished to a _śītavana_ he will be [like] nothing other than a discarded corpse. The people will be more cautious and protect themselves in order to avoid living in such a shameful spot.” The king said, “Good! Make an announcement to notify all the inhabitants.”

Soon after the palace itself caught fire and the king said to his ministers, “I must move my lodgings.” He ordered the prince to act as regent to attend to state affairs and for the sake of upholding the impartiality of the national law he made up his mind to go live [in the cemetery]. At that time, hearing that King Bimbisāra was living in a cemetery in the wilderness, the king of Vaiśālī mustered his troops and made ready to launch a surprise attack. According to information sent back by his frontier guards, a city had been built [at the cemetery], called the City of the Royal House, and the king had moved there. Government officials and common people had also moved to live in the new city. It is also said that this city was built at the time of King Ajātaśatru. When Prince Ajātaśatru ascended the throne he made this city his capital, but after King Aśoka moved the capital to Pāṭaliputra he gave Rājagṛha to the brahmans. Hence there are no ordinary inhabitants in this city, only less than a thousand brahman families.

At the southwest corner of the palace city there are two small monasteries where guest monks from different countries may make stay in the course of their travels. This was a place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma. Further to the northwest is a stupa built at the native place of Elder Jyotiṣka (known in Chinese as Xingli, “Heavenly Body,” formerly mistranscribed as Shutijia). On the left side of the road outside the south gate of the city is a stupa at the spot where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma and ordained Rāhula.

From here going north for more than thirty _li,_ I reached Nālandā Monastery (known in Chinese as Shiwuyan, “Insatiable in Almsgiving”). I heard some old people say that in the mango grove to the south of the monastery there was a pond where a dragon named Nālandā lived, hence the name of the monastery built beside the pond. In facts, when the Tathāgata was practicing bodhisattva deeds in a former life he was a great king who founded his capital at this place. Because he had compassion for living beings and took delight in almsgiving, the people called him “Insatiable in Almsgiving” in praise of his virtue, and this monastery was named after this appellation. The land for building the monastery was originally a mango grove; five hundred merchants purchased it with ten _koṭis_ of gold coins and presented it to the Buddha. The Buddha preached the Dharma at this place for three months and thereupon the merchants attained sainthood. Not long after the Buddha’s nirvana, Sakrāditya (known as Tiri, “Sun of Indra,” in Chinese), a former king of this country, who esteemed the One Vehicle and honored the Triple Gem, selected this propitious spot by divination and constructed the monastery here. When the construction work began the dragon’s body was pierced, and a _nirgrantha_ (naked Jain ascetic) who was a good diviner saw this and predicted, “This is a propitious site. The monastery built on it will certainly be prosperous and become the standard for all the five parts of India. It will continue to thrive for more than a thousand years. Students of future generations in this monastery will easily gain achievements in their studies but most of them will spit blood, because the dragon has been injured.”

Sakrāditya’s son, King Buddhagupta (known as Juehu, “Buddha-protected,” in Chinese), succeeded to the throne to continue the good works and built another monastery to the south of the original one. King Tathāgatagupta (known as Rulai, “Thus-come,” in Chinese) earnestly followed the example of his predecessors and built another monastery to the east. After ascending the throne, King Bālāditya (known as Youri, “Morning Sun”) built a fourth one to the northeast. After the construction work was completed a festive meeting was held to celebrate the occasion, at which both prominent and obscure persons were entertained with sincerity and holy as well as ordinary monks were invited. Monks from the five parts of India traveled long distances to attend the meeting. Two monks arrived late, after all the participants had been seated, and they were led to the third story. Someone asked them, “When the king prepared the feast he first sent invitations to the holy and ordinary monks. Why have you two virtuous ones arrived so late, and where have you come from?” They said, “We come from China. Because our teacher is ill we served him his meal before we started the journey. But we were invited by the king and we have come to attend the meeting from a great distance.” The inquirer was surprised to hear this and promptly made a report to the king, who, knowing that the two monks were saints, went in person to greet them. He arrived at the storied pavilion too late, however, and the two monks had already gone somewhere unknown to the others. The king’s faith was deepened and he eventually relinquished the monarchy to become a homeless monk. After he became a monk he was the lowest in rank in the community of monks and this made him unhappy and discontented. He thought, “When I was a king I used to occupy the uppermost position but now as a monk I am relegated to a humble position behind all the other monks.” He went to tell the monks how he felt, and they then called a meeting and made a rule that those who were not yet fully ordained could establish their seniority according to age, which became a tradition peculiar to this monastery.

This king’s son, Vajra (known as Jingang, “Diamond,” in Chinese), was a man of firm faith. After his succession to the throne he built a monastery to the west. Later, a king of Central India built another great monastery to the north and constructed a lofty enclosure with one gate for all the monasteries. Because the entire complex was constructed by kings of successive dynasties, the buildings were erected by the most exquisitely skilled carpenters, employing such tools as burins and curved chisels to make the architectural complex a really magnificent sight. In the great monastery built by King Sakrāditya there is an image of the Buddha. Forty monks are assigned to take their meal every day in this monastery in honor of the almsgivers’ kindness. There are several thousand monks, all of whom are brilliant scholars of high learning; those whose virtue is esteemed by their contemporaries and whose reputation is known in foreign lands number in the several hundreds. They are pure in observing the monastic regulations and faultless in conduct according to the Vinaya rules. The monks have strict restrictions and they are all chaste and spotless, so that they are looked up to as exemplars in the various countries in India. They always ask for more instructions and deliberate on the abstruse theories incessantly all day long. They admonish each other day and night and extend mutual help between old and young. Anyone who did not engage in discussion of the profound teachings of the Tripiṭaka would be ashamed of themselves. Thus foreign scholars who wish to win fame come here to clarify the dubious points they found in their learning before they can join the ranks of the well-reputed. Some travel about citing the name of this monastery to fraudulently gain honor and consideration. Most of the people from different regions and countries who desire to enter this monastery to hold discussions are barred from entering the establishment after a preliminary interrogation by the gatekeeper. Only those who are well versed in both ancient and contemporary learning can gain admittance. The visiting students carry on debates with the resident monks but seven or eight out of ten flee in defeat. The remaining two or three learned scholars may also be deflated of their arrogance since then reputation can be damaged by questions raised later by the resident monks. Highly talented and versatile sages endowed with retentive memory and good virtue maintain the glory of the monastery and follow in the wake of their predecessors. Dharmapāla and Candragupta, who won their fame in the scope of the bequeathed teachings of the Buddha; Guṇamati and Sthiramati, whose good repute is well known even today; Prabhāmitra, skilled in theoretical discussion; Viśeṣamitra, fluent in elevated conversation; Jñānacandra of elegant demeanor and perspicacious discernment; and Sīlabhadra of sublime virtue and profound insight—all were men of supreme quality, well known to all, whose virtuous deeds excelled those of their forerunners. They are well versed in ancient learning, each having composed more than ten widely popular treatises that are highly valued even today.

The sacred traces around the monastery are counted by the hundreds, of which I shall cite just two or three as brief examples.

Not far to the west of the monastery is a temple where the Tathāgata once stayed for three months and spoke extensively on the wonderful Dharma for various _devas_ and people. More than a hundred paces to the south is a small stupa at the place where a _bhikṣu_ coming from a distance saw the Buddha. Once a _bhikṣu_ approached from a distance and met the Tathāgata and the holy monks at this place. With a mind of veneration, the _bhikṣu_ prostrated himself [before the Tathāgata] and wished to be a universal monarch. Seeing him the Tathāgata told the assembly of monks, “This _bhikṣu_ is very pitiful. He is a man of great bliss and deep virtue with a mind of firm faith, and he would have realized buddhahood very soon if he had aimed at [that goal]. But he wishes only to become a universal monarch and he will surely get the reward in his future lives and be a universal monarch for as many lifetimes as [there are] atoms of dust from the place wher he now prostrates down to the gold wheel beneath the earth. Because of his addiction to worldly pleasure he is far removed from the realization of sainthood.”

To the south is a standing statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. Sometimes it has been seen proceeding to the Buddha’s temple and circumambulating it to the right with a censer in its hand. In the stupa to the south of the statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva are kept hair and fingernail [relic]s of the Buddha, shaven and clipped over a three-month period. Sick people are often cured of their illnesses by circumambulating the stupa. The stupa beside the tank at the outside of the west wall of the enclosure was the place where a heretic, holding a small bird in his hand, asked the Buddha about the problem of life and death. More than fifty paces further to the southeast, inside the enclosure, is an extraordinary tree, eight or nine feet high with two branches.

The Tathāgata once chewed a piece of willow twig [to clean his teeth] and threw the used twig to the ground, where it took root and grew into this tree. Although a long time has passed the branches never increase or decrease in number. Next, to the east is a great temple more than two hundred feet in height. The Tathāgata once spoke on various wonderful Dharmas at this place for four months. More than one hundred paces further to the north is a temple in which is enshrined an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. When pure devotees come to make offerings they see it at various places, either standing beside the gate or under the eaves outside the temple, as it has no fixed position. Both monks and laypeo- ple from different countries come to make offerings to the image. To the north of the temple of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is a great temple, more than three hundred feet high, built by King Bālāditya. Its size and ornamentation and the Buddha’s image within are similar to those of the great temple at the _bodhi_ tree. The stupa to the northeast is the place where the Tathāgata once expounded the wonderful Dharma for seven days, while to the northwest is a sitting place of the four past buddhas. To the south is Brass Temple, constructed by King Sīlāditya, though the work is unfinished. According to the drawing of the building when completed it will be one hundred feet in height. Further to the east, more than two hundred paces outside the enclosure, is a copper image of the Buddha in the standing posture, over eighty feet tall and sheltered by a pavilion as high as six stories. It was made by King Pūrṇavarman in olden times.

Two or three _li_ north of the copper image of the Buddha made by King Pūrṇavarman is a brick temple in which is enshrined an image of Tārā Bodhisattva, tall in size with an obvious spiritual manifestation. Profuse offerings are made to the image every New Year’s Day and the kings, ministers, and wealthy people of neighboring regions, holding fragrant incense and flowers as well as precious canopies and parasols, come to join the seven-day ceremony performed amid the harmonious music of bells, stone chimes, and string and wind instruments. Inside the south gate of the enclosure is a large well. Formerly when the Buddha was living in the world a group of merchants who were suffering from heat and thirst came to this place and the World- honored One pointed at the earth and said that water might be obtained there. The lord of the merchants dug into the ground with the axle of a cart and water gushed out from the depression in the earth. All those who drank the water and heard the Dharma became enlightened and attained sainthood.

Going southwest for eight or nine _li_ from the monastery I reached the town of Kolika, in which there is a stupa built by King Aśoka. This was the birthplace of Venerable Maudgalaputra. Beside it is another stupa built at the spot where the venerable monk entered final nirvana; his relic bones were entombed in it. Maudgalaputra was born into a great brahman family and was a close friend of Sāriputra since their youth. Sāriputra was noted for his brilliant talent, while Venerable Maudgalaputra was reputed for his fine discernment. They were equals in genius and wisdom and were always together, whether traveling or staying at a place, having forged a lifelong friendship, and they vowed to take similar actions in their activities. Both of them grew disgusted with the world and renounced their homes together, serving Sañjaya as their teacher. When Sāriputra met with the arhat Aśvajit he heard the Dharma from the latter and attained sainthood. He immediately repeated what he had heard from the arhat to Venerable Maudgalaputra, who upon hearing the Dharma became enlightened and realized the first stage of sainthood. Maudgalaputra came to the place of the Buddha with his two hundred and fifty disciples. When the World-honored One saw him from a distance he pointed at the newcomer and told the assembly of monks, “That person coming from over there will become the disciple most notable for his miraculous powers.” After arriving at the Buddha’s place Maudgalaputra requested that he be admitted into the brotherhood of the Dharma. The World-honored One replied to him, “Welcome, _bhikṣu!_ By living a pure life you will be free from the bondage of suffering.” At the sound of these words Maudgalaputra’s beard and hair fell off and his secular garments changed. He observed the disciplinary rules in a pure manner and behaved in the proper way. After seven days he became free from the bondage of rebirth, attained arhatship, and gained miraculous powers.

Three or four _li_ to the east of the Maudgalaputra’s birthplace is a stupa at the spot where King Bimbisāra welcomed the Buddha. After the Tathāgata first realized buddhahood he sensed that the people of Magadha longed to meet him. At King Bimbisāra’s invitation he dressed himself properly, took up his almsbowl one morning, and went to the city of Rājagṛha accompanied by a thousand _bhikṣus._ These _bhikṣus_ had formerly been brahmans who wore their hair in the shape of a conch on the top of their heads but in admiration of the Dharma they had donned the dyed robes to follow the Buddha. At that time Indra transformed himself into a _māṇava_ (a young brahman) wearing a topknot in the shape of a conch; he held a golden vase in his left hand, carried a precious staff in his right hand, and walked in the air four fingers’ [height] above the ground, leading the way for the Buddha among the congregation. King Bimbisāra of the country of Magadha, together with the brahmans, elders, and laypeople of his country, hundreds and thousands in number, came out of the city of Rājagṛha to greet the group of holy monks.

Going southeast for more than twenty _li_ from the place where King Bimbisāra welcomed the Buddha, I reached the town of Kālapināka, in which there is a stupa built by King Aśoka. This was the birthplace of Venerable Sāriputra. The well is still in existenceand beside it is a stupa built at the spot where the venerable monk entered nirvana;d his relic bones are preserved in the stupa.

Venerable Sāriputra was born in a great brahman’s family. His father was a highly talented scholar of extensive knowledge, with deep insight into what was subtle and abstruse and well read in various texts. His wife once had a dream and told it to her husband, saying, “Last night I had a dream in which I saw a strange man clad in armor holding a diamond club in his hand. He demolished all the mountains, except the one by which he calmly stood.” Her husband said, “It is a good dream. You will give birth to a son who will be a learned scholar in the world and defeat all _śāstra_ masters and refute their theories. He will be inferior to only one person and will become that person’s disciple.” In the course of her pregnancy the woman suddenly became wise and intelligent and could carry on a discussion eloquently without faltering in her speech. When Venerable Sāriputra was eight years old his name spread far to the four quarters. He was honest and guileless by nature and had a mind of compassion. He destroyed the bondage of rebirth and achieved wisdom. He was Maudgalaputra’s friend since their youth. They detested the world but did not know where to take refuge. So they went to the place of the heretic Sañjaya for spiritual practice and cultivation, but they told each other, “What we are learning here is not the ultimate truth; it cannot free us from the scope of suffering. We should each go by a [different] route to seek a brilliant teacher. Whichever of us tastes the sweet dew first must tell the other so that he may also enjoy it.”

At that time the arhat Aśvajit, almsbowl in hand, was going to the city on almsround. Seeing that he was peaceful and elegant in demeanor, Śāriputra asked him, “Who is your teacher?” [Aśvajit replied,] “The prince of the Śākya clan who, weary of the world, renounced his home and achieved full enlightenment, is my teacher.” Śāriputra said, “What Dharma did he preach? Can I hear of it?” [Aśvajit said,] “I have just started receiving instructions and I have not yet mastered the profound teachings.” Śāriputra said, “Please tell me just as much as you have heard.” Aśvajit then expounded the Dharma as was suitable for the occasion. On hearing the Dharma Śāriputra attained the first stage of sainthood and, together with his two hundred and fifty disciples, he came to the place of the Buddha. When the World-honored One saw him from a distance he pointed at him and told the assembly of monks, “[That person] will be the foremost in wisdom among all my disciples.” Śāriputra saluted the Buddha and wished to follow the buddha-dharma. The World-honored One said to him, “Welcome, _bhikṣu!”_ Hearing these words, Śāriputra became a fully ordained monk and half a month later, when he heard the Buddha preaching the Dharma to the long-nailed brahman, he became enlightened and realized arhatship.

Later, when Ānanda heard about the time of the Buddha’s [approaching] nirvana, he spread the news to many people, who were aggrieved and saddened. Śāriputra too was deeply saddened by the news. He could not bear the idea of the Buddha entering nirvana so he asked permission of the World-honored One to allow him to die first. The World-honored One told him, “You should know that this is the right time for you to do so.” [Śāriputra] then departed from his disciples and returned to his native place. His attendant _śrāmaṇera_ informed the inhabitants in the city and the towns of Śāriputra’s intention. King Ajātaśatru and the people of his country came in a great hurry and assembled together like clouds. Śāriputra expounded the Dharma extensively for them and, after hearing the Dharma, the audience dispersed. Late in the night he concentrated his mind and entered the _samādhi_ of complete cessation of sensation and perception. When he came out of the _samādhi_ he passed into nirvana.

Four or five _li_ to the southeast of the town of Kālapināka is a stupa at the place where the disciples of Venerable Śāriputra entered nirvana. It is also said that at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha the great arhat Trikoṭi _(koṭi_ meaning “one hundred million” in Chinese) entered final nirvana at this same place.

Going to the east for more than thirty _li_ from the stupa of Śāriputra’s disciples, I reached Indraśailaguhā Mountain (known as Dishiku, “Indra’s Cave,” in Chinese). The mountain valleys are deep and quiet, with exuberant flowers and trees. There are two prominent peaks on the mountain’s summit. On the south cliff of the west peak is a large cave, wide but not high, where formerly the Tathāgata often stayed. In those days Indra carved marks on the rock concerning forty-two dubious points about which he inquired of the Buddham, who gave him explanations. The marks are still there. The present image [in the cave] was made in imitation of the posture of the Buddha as he was on that occasion. All of those who entered the cave to worship the image was inspired with a feeling of awe and veneration. On the crag of the mountain are sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked back and forth. On the east peak is a monastery. The local people say that at night the monks of this monastery often see lamps and candles burning brightly before the image in the cave on the east peak.

In front of the monastery on the east peak of Indraśailaguhā Mountain is a stupa named Hamsa (“Wild Goose”). The monks of this monastery once practiced the Hinayana teachings. Because these are gradual teachings, the monks were allowed to eat the three kinds of pure meat and this habit persisted Later, after the three kinds of pure meat had become unobtainable, a _bhikṣu,_ while taking a walk, saw a flock of wild geese flying overhead. He said in jest, “Today the monks are running short of food for theft midday meal. The Mahāsattva should know that this is the right time [to make a sacrifice]!” Before he had finished speaking one of the wild geese flew back and dropped dead on the ground in front of the monk. Seeing this incident, the _bhikṣu_ related it to all the monks, who were sad to hear it and said among themselves, “The Tathāgata preached the Dharma according to the faculty of understanding of those in the audience, in order to guide and induce them to enlightenment. We have been stupidly following the gradual teachings. The Mahayana tenets are the right principles and we should correct our former behavior and follow the holy teachings. This wild goose is our clever guide and it came to admonish us. Its great virtue should be glorified and the event transmitted to posterity.” Thus a stupa was built in memory of its spirit of sacrifice, and the dead goose was buried under it.

Going northeast for one hundred and fifty or sixty _li_ from Indraśailaguhā Mountain, I reached Kapotaka (“Pigeon”) Monastery where more than two hundred monks lived; they study the teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school. To the east of the monastery is a stupa built by King Aśoka. The Buddha once preached the Dharma to the monks at this place for an entire night. Meanwhile a bird catcher was catching some of the feathered tribe with a net in the wood but he failed to get any birds for a whole day. He said, “I lack good fortune and whatever I do is always adverse for me.” He came to the place of the Buddha and declared, “Today the Tathāgata is preaching the Dharma here and I am unable to catch any birds with my net. What should I do to feed my starving wife and children?” The Tathāgata told him, “Build a fire! I shall give you food.” The Tathāgata then took the form of a pigeon and burned himself to death in the fire. The bird catcher took the dead pigeon home and ate it with his wife and children. Later, he returned to the place of tile Buddha, who converted him in an appropriate way. On hearing the Dharma the bird catcher repented of his misdeeds, made a fresh start in life by relinquishing his home for spiritual cultivation, and realized sainthood. Thus the monastery constructed at this place was named Pigeon Monastery.

Two or three _li_ to the south of Kapotaka Monastery is an isolated hill that is tall and precipitous, covered by splendid flowers, with luxuriant trees and clear streams. On the hill there are many beautifully constructed temples and shrines with most exquisite carvings and engravings. In the central temple an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is enshrined; it is small in size but august and mystical in spiritual manifestation. The figure holds a lotus flower in one hand and has a small statuette on its forehead. Some people once fasted and prayed earnestly for seven days, a fortnight, or even one month here, wishing to see the bodhisattva in person. Someone who had gained spiritual influence saw [Avalokiteśvara] Bodhisattva, a majestic and stately figure with a bright radiance, come out of the image to give him comfort and advice.

In former times, the king of the country of Siṃhala in the South Sea looked in Iris mirror one morning but he did not see his own reflection, and instead saw the image of this bodhisattva in a wood of _tala_ trees on a small hill in the country of Magadha in Jambudvīpa. Deeply delighted, the king set out to seek the image. When he came to this hill he found that the image here was similar to the one he had seen in his mirror, so he built the temple and made various offerings to the image. The kings of later times followed his example and built more temples and shrines beside it; offerings of incense, flowers, and music were made incessantly.

Going southeast for more than forty _li_ from the image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva on the isolated hill, I reached a monastery with more than fifty monks, all of whom studied the Hinayana teachings. In front of the monastery is a great stupa that revealed miraculous signs many times. Formerly the Buddha preached the Dharma to Brahmā and others at this place for seven days. Beside it are ruins where the three past buddhas sat and walked back and forth.

Going northeast for more than seventy _li_ from the monastery I reached a big village south of the Ganges River, with a dense population of prosperous villagers. There are several _deva_ temples, all beautifully adorned with engravings. Not far to the southeast is a great stupa at the place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma for one night.

Going east from here through mountains and forests for over one hundred _li,_ I reached Lāvaṇīla Village. The great stupa in front of the monastery here was built by King Aśoka. The Buddha once preached the Dharma here for three months. Two or three _li_ to the north of this place is a large lake more than thirty _li_ in circuit with lotus flowers in four colors blooming all four seasons of the year.

Going east from here through great mountains and forests for more than two hundred _li,_ I reached the country of Īraṇaparvata (in the domain of Central India).
